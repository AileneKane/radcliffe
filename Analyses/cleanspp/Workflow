Cleaning species lists: Preparing for the phenology workshop 4-6 April 2016
Miriam Johnston (mjohnston@g.harvard.edu), 23 March 2016

=========================================================================

INPUTS:

(1) csv of observational species in the following format:
Site	|	Genus.Species
(2) csv of experimental species in the following format:
Site	|	Genus.Species
(3) R code snippets DataProcessing.R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUTS (cleaned):

(1) csv of observational species in the following format:
site	|	orig.Genus	|	orig.Species	|	clean.Genus	|	clean.Species
(2) csv of experimental species in the following format:
site	|	orig.Genus	|	orig.Species	|	clean.Genus	|	clean.Species
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOALS & GUIDELINES:

(1) Make sure there are no spelling mistakes in genus/species names
(2) Update genus/species names to the most recent taxonomy to identify and avoid repetition 
(3) If there's a variety listed (var.) --> delete
(4) If 'NA' in species column --> keep
(5) If 'spp' in species column --> change to NA
(6) If a single site has >1 of the same clean.Genus and clean.Species, collapse

WORKFLOW (follow separately for the 2 input csvs):

(1) Put data in correct format for the ITIS database: Run chunks 1 & 2 in DataProcessing.R
(2) Create the (uncorrected) file in the format we eventually want (this will be edited by hand): Run chunk 3 in DataProcessing.R
(3) Put data into ITIS database
	(a) Go to http://www.itis.gov/taxmatch.html
	(b) Import data from step 1 ("_format")
	(c) Choose "Plantae" and then "Taxon Compare"; leave all other options as default
(4) Hand-correct misspellings
	(a) Scroll down on the webpage to look at the "Non-matches between ITIS and input file" section
	(b) Find the listed names on the file created in step 2 ("_toclean"), correct in the clean.Genus and clean.Species columns; leave other columns alone
		Note: we have already changed spp and spp --> NA in the species column, so just deal with the misspellings.
	(c) Double-check all entries with only genus names, since database will not identify these as misspellings
(5) Hand-update names with most taxonomically correct - this will ensure there are no repeats that are synonyms.
	(a) Use the "Matches" section of the ITIS output
	(b) Double-check that the non acceptance is not just a database artifact by searching the genus name at www.itis.gov
	(c) Hand-update clean.Species and clean.Genus fields to reflect the "Accepted Name" column in ITIS, assuming not a database artifact
		Note: ignore any variations or subspecies ('var.' or 'ssp.'). (Ex): if Accepted name = Acer saccharum var. saccharum, put
				clean.Genus	|	clean.Species
				Acer		|	saccharum
		Note: if there is an 'X' in the "Accepted Name" column, put it in the cean.Species column. (Ex): if Accepted name = Circaea X intermedia, put
				clean.Genus	|	clean.Species
				Circaea		|	X intermedia
	(d) In the case of the observations, where several species had 2 accepted synonyms: do a search in "_clean" and make sure that only one is present
	(e) save spreadsheet ("_toclean")
(6) Double-check the corrections in ITIS database (note that some of the spelling mistakes might not be preferred names, etc.)
	(a) Run chunk 5 in DataProcessing.R
	(b) Check the file that is produced ("_check") in the ITIS database
(7) Hand-correct again; iterate until ITIS shows no "not accepted" in the Name Usage column (or these are all database artifacts) and all the unmatched names have NA instead of spp.
	(a) Continue to run chunk 5 in DataProcessing.R & then import the new file ("_check") into ITIS. No filename changes necessary
(8) Ensure that there are no repeats of site/clean.Genus/clean.Species entries, or repeats are labeled
	(a) Run chunk 6 in DataProcessing.R
		Note: see comments in DataProcessing.R to determine treatment of repeat entries
(9) Produce Final cleaned file of species names
	(a) Run chunk 7 in DataProcessing.R
