Radcliffe Metanalysis Experimental Design Metadata
These data were compiled from multiple experimental studies that manipulated temperature (and in some cases precipitation as well) and monitored phenology. 
The data were generously shared by authors of the experiments and should only be used by members of the Radcliffe “Predicting Future Springs” Working Group 
for purposes outlined in the working group. 
Contact Ailene Ettinger or Lizzie Wolkovich if you would like to use the data for other purposes.

Ecology, 79(4), 1998, pp. 1261–1271.
Plot design: 
10 plots, 3m X 10m in size and separated by >2m, were established in an alpine meadow at RMBL.
Plots numbered consequetively and odd-numbered plots were heated by electric heaters suspended 2.5 m above them.

Heating Method:
Parabolic reflectors were installed above the heating elements and caused "nearly uniform delivery of 15 W/m2 of 
IR radiation over the central 80% of each warmed plot, 5 W/m2 at the periphery and in a central band between the heaters, 
and no additional radiation to neighboring control plots."

Soil temperature measurements:
Thermocouples were buried 5, 12, and 25 cm deep at three positions in each plot, recorded temperature every 2 h.

15 plots in the
forest understory: nine are heated chambers, three are
unheated control chambers, and three are control plots that
lack chambers but are the same size as the chambers. The
octagonal open-top chambers have a volume of 21.7 m3 (5 m
in diameter, 1.2 m wall height) and are located on a north-facing
slope (6–15% slope) above a small creek. The chambers are
heated by forced air blown over hydronic radiators fed by a
closed-loop mixture of hot water and propylene glycol (antifreeze).
To control for effects of wind, unheated chambers had
the same forced air delivery system minus the radiators. Heat
delivery to the chambers began in January 2010, and chambers
are heated year-round, both day and night. The experiment
uses a regression design of chamber heating, where each
chamber is heated to a target of 1.5–5.5 °C above ambient temperature
with 0.5 °C increments between chambers. Maintaining
a precise target air temperature over long time periods is
difficult, and the assigned treatment levels varied by a small
amount over time (but were not statistically different from target
temperatures, see Fig. S1). This design is particularly useful
for revealing potential nonlinearities and threshold effects
in plant temperature responses.
Air temperature (two temperature probes per chamber at
22 cm above ground level), soil temperature (two sensors buried
2 cm and two sensors buried 6 cm below the surface), relative
humidity (HS-2000V capacitive polymer sensor; Precon,
Memphis, TN, USA), soil moisture (Model CS616 TDR probes,
Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA), and photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR; Model SQ110; Apogee Instruments
Inc., Logan, UT, USA) were measured inside each
experimental chamber every minute and recorded as hourly
means by automated dataloggers (CR1000; Campbell Scientific
Inc.). Further details of the warming experiment can be found
in Pelini et al. (2011).
To determine how environmental conditions varied among
experimental chambers, mean air temperature, soil temperature,
vapor pressure deficit (VPD), PAR, and relative extractable
soil water content (REW) were calculated for each
chamber. REW was calculated according to the equation
