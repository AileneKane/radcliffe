Ecology, 79(4), 1998, pp. 1261–1271.
Plot design: 
10 plots, 3m X 10m in size and separated by >2m, were established in an alpine meadow at RMBL.
Plots numbered consequetively and odd-numbered plots were heated by electric heaters suspended 2.5 m above them.

Heating Method:
Parabolic reflectors were installed above the heating elements and caused "nearly uniform delivery of 15 W/m2 of 
IR radiation over the central 80% of each warmed plot, 5 W/m2 at the periphery and in a central band between the heaters, 
and no additional radiation to neighboring control plots."
Heaters activated in January 1991 and operated continuously. In May 1993 a third heater was added to each warmed plot, raising the incident IR flux to 22 W/m2 and removing the central ‘‘cold spot.’’

Soil temperature measurements:
Thermocouples were buried 5, 12, and 25 cm deep at three positions in each plot, recorded temperature every 2 h.

At Duke, no phenology data were collected from one chamber (G08, warmed 5 degrees) for some reason

temperate plants under experimental warming." Global Change Biology (2015) 21, 3138–3151
Plot design: 
15 plots in forest understory: 9 heated chambers,3 unheated control chambers ("shams"), and 3 control plots with no chambers 
octagonal open-top chambers have a volume of 21.7 m3 (5 m in diameter, 1.2 m wall height) 

Heating Method:
Forced air blown over hydronic radiators fed by a closed-loop mixture of hot water and propylene glycol (antifreeze).
Unheated chambers had same forced air delivery system minus the radiators. 
chambers heated year-round, both day and night. 
Regression design of chamber heating: each chamber heated to target of 1.5–5.5 °C above ambient temperature, with 0.5 °C increments between chambers. 

Air temperature measurements:
2 temperature probes per chamber at 22 cm above ground level

Soil temperature measurements:
2 sensors buried at 2 cm and 2 sensors buried 6 cm below ground surface

warming, at north and south range limits." Functional Ecology 2014, 28, 1344–1355.

Plot design: 
18 17-m2 rectangular open-top chambers per site at 2 sites (Duke Forest and Harvard Forest) established in deciduous forest
in a factorial design with three temperatures (ambient, +3 °C, +5 °C assigned randomly)
Within each chamber, two 4.6 m 9 1.05 m areas were designated as ‘experimental strips’ for soil heating and seed establishment.. Chamber walls are transparent plastic greenhouse sheeting attached to wooden frames, with heights of 2.5 m. 

3 additional control plots per site had no chamber ("ambient" in our meta-analysis) 
unheated chambers received buried cables as a disturbance control and air circulating through these chambers was not heated.

Half of chambers at each site (n=9) were located in artificial gaps (plot names beginning with "G") created in 2008 and half were located in intact-canopy stands (plot names beginning with "S")

Heating Method:
Soil and air heated with independent systems to track ambient temperatures with the consistent +3 °C and +5 °C offsets.
Soil heated with electric resistance cable buried 10 cm deep at 20-cm spacing. Temperature offsets were
maintained by an automated tracking system. 
Air heated indirectly with propane. Heated water with non-toxic propylene glycol was pumped to a heat-exchange coil
and airflow system in +3 and +5 chambers.  The temperature offset maintained by a defined heat delivery rate. 
Harvard site not heated from December through March when snow-cover present.

Soil temperature measured 10 cm deep
Air temperatures measured 30 cm above-ground

Plot design: 
16  2x2 m plots established in a two-factorial randomized complete block design in cleared deciduous forest site
4 blocks with one plot of each of the following treatments: warming only, precipitation only, warming + precipitation, and ambient.
Plots treated from May 2008 through August 2010, spaced a minimum of 10 m apart to minimize the effects of neighboring treatments 

Heating method:
Plots were warmed with suspended infrared heaters, with target temperature increases above ambient of 1.5 °C during the day and 3 °C at night.  
One 240 V infrared heater was suspended 1.5 m above each plot. A real-time proportional-integrative-derivative
feedback system controlled warming through infrared radiometer (IRR) monitoring of surface temperatures in
warmed and not warmed plots. 
Ambient and precipitation only plots that did not receive warming treatments had heater replicas to replicate shading and drip-line effects of the lamp structures in warmed plots.
Precipitation treatments:
Weekly additions of collected rainwater or snow that equaled 20% of the 1882–2005 monthly mean historical record from State College, PA (US Historical Climatology Data Network, Easterling et al., 1996). "April through December precipitation treatments were added in the form of water collected in a series of rainwater catchments distributed throughout the site. In winter months (December–March), precipitation was collected in a series of open topped plastic bins and distributed as water, ice, or snow, depending on the state at time of application."

Plot design:
30 1.25X1.25 m plots grouped into five blocks. In each block, six plots received either ambient temperature conditions or increased temperature treatment of +1.5C or +3C compared with ambient temperature, and either ambient precipitation or reduced precipitation by 30% compared with ambient precipitation during spring and summer. Treatments’ levels were chosen according to climate predictions for the French Mediterranean region for 2100 (IPCC, 2001). The experimental design was a factorial split plot on a randomized complete block design. 

Heating method:
 two infrared heaters (80 cm, 800 W, Vulcanic; Paris, France) equipped with reflectors installed at 1 m height laterally at the eastern and western border of the plot to avoid shading. At each plot air temperature was monitored by infrared sensors (Raytek; Thermalert MID MIC, Berlin, Germany) at a height of 1 m, which were protected within a plastic cap. As these sensors were revealed to be poorly robust in outdoor conditions, supplementary thermocouples and PT100 sensors were installed in two of the five repetitions, and periodic measurements with an infrared manual sensor (Raytek; Thermalert MID MIC, Berlin, Germany) were made. 

Precipitation treatments:
The plots of the reduced water supply treatment were equipped with an automatic, extensible shelter system composed of six plastic gutters. The shelter was activated by a rain sensor 12V (Kemo, Langen, Germany) and reduced incoming rainwater by c. 30% during spring and summer. During the summer 2003, which was particularly hot and dry, all plots were occasionally watered with 15 l and 10 l of water for normal and reduced water supply treatments, respectively, in order to attenuate drought stress, but in

Plot design:
15 experimental plots in the forest understorey: 12 of the plots have octagonal chambers with 9 heated and 3 are unheated chamber controls. Each site also has 3 chamberless control plots that lack chambers but are equal in surface area to the chambers. Vegetation within the experimental plots was not cleared prior to chamber construction. chambers are 5 m in diameter with eight walls. Each chamber has a±20-cm-diameter oak tree (Quercus rubra), that provides a large thermal storage mass at the centre of the plot that reduces a ‘cold core’ in the middle of the chamber (as the chambers are essentially chimneys) and increases thermal mixing. Chamber walls are composed of wood frames attached to metal fence posts and are covered with plastic greenhouse sheeting. The bottoms of the chamber walls are elevated 2–3 cm above the ground so that movement of ants and other arthropods into and out of the chambers is not restricted. 

Heating method:
forced air blown over hydronic radiators fed by a closed-loop mixture of hot water and antifreeze (propylene glycol).Water is heated with onsite, propane-fuelled highefficiency Prestige Solo condensing water boilers (Triangle Tube, Blackwood, NJ, USA) and is delivered to the chambers through 1- and 1¼-inch (2Æ54 and 3Æ175 cm)-diameter Insulpex piping (Rehau, Leesburg, VA, USA). For each heated chamber, heat is transferred to the air via a copper coil heat exchanger (Model HF2-17518; Smith’s Environmental Products Ltd., Randolph,MA,USA),and the heat level is controlled by a Belimo valve (3-way valve set via an LR-24 actuator; Belimo America, Danbury, CT, USA). The highefficiency boilers work best when running constantly. Thus, temperature in each chamber is controlled by adjusting fan speed and hot water flow through the Belimo valve, not by thermostats that would repeatedly cycle the boilers on and off. Once heated, air is delivered to the chambers by blowers (FKD12XL blower; Fantech, Lenexa, KS, USA) through 15-cm-diameter plastic plena (Figs 2 and 3b). The plena, which hang 45 cm above the ground, run in two concentric

Plot design: 
Randomized block, split-plot with 8 replicates of each treatment. 
Elevated CO2 and warming were applied to whole circular plots (each 2-m diameter, 3.14-m2 area), whereas N deposition and increased precipitation were applied in a factorial arrangement to four 0.78 m2 quadrants within each plot. We excluded elevated CO2 and N treatments from this analysis, and use only ambient CO2 and ambient N treatments. Global change treatments were applied to undisturbed grassland plots beginning in November 1998, and are presently ongoing.

Heating method:
Plots were warmed with suspended infrared heaters, with target temperature increases above ambient of 1.5 °C

Precipitation treatments:
An irrigation system increased precipitation by supplementing +50% to every rainfall event. In addition, we extended the wet season by 20 days with two supplemental irrigation events. 

We have phenology data from 32 plots, and climate data from 44 plots.
