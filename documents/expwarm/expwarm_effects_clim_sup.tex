\section* {Additional methods for database development}
For our literature review, we searched Web of Science (ISI) for Topic=(warm* OR temperature*) AND Topic=(plant* AND phenolog*) AND Topic=(experiment* OR manip*). We restricted dates to the time period after the STONE database (i.e., January 2011 through March 2015). This yielded 277 new studies. We removed all passive warming studies from the list, and contacted authors for daily data. Three additional datasets were offered or suggested to us, and in March 2018, we added additional studies found by using the same terms to search the following online databases for additional datasets: dataONE (https://search.dataone.org/), KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), and dryad (https://www.datadryad.org/). The resulting database contains daily climate data collected between 1991 and 2015 from 15 North American, European, and Chinese climate change experiments (Table \ref{tab:methods}, Figure \ref{fig:map}). %We were unable to include the following studies because authors declined to share their data or did not respond: \citep{schwartzberg2014,moser2011,caron2015,ellebjerg2008}.

\section* {Details of statistical analyses and results}
For all analyses, we use mixed-effects models implemented with the lme4 package in R, version 3.2.4 \citep{bates2015,rcoreteam2017}. Mixed-effects models, also called multi-level or hierarchical models, can account for structured data that violate the independence assumption of traditional linear regression \citep{gelman2007}. In our analyses, we use levels/groupings of experimental site, year, and day of year (doy) to account for this mutual dependence among data points. We use three as a minimum threshold for sample size within each level/grouping, for fixed and random effects (i.e., there must be at least three observations within each level/group for it to be considered as a separate group in our analyses). To test for significance of fixed effects in our models, we use Type II tests for models including only main effects and Type III tests for models including interactions, as well as main effects. 
\subsection* {Analysis of effects of warming on daily temperature range}
To test how active warming alters daily temperature range (DTR, the difference between maximum and minimum temperatures in a day), we used data from eight (for above-ground) and ten (for soil) studies in the MC3E database that include daily measurements of above-ground (i.e., air, canopy, surface) and soil temperature maxima and minima. These data were from studies that used infrared warming with feedback control (n=2), infrared with constant control (n=4), forced air (n=2), and combined forced air and soil cable (n=2) warming types.  For consistency, we included only structural controls (we therefore excluded exp15, which used only ambient controls), and also excluded data from plots with precipitation treatments. We fit linear mixed-effect models with above-ground DTR, soil DTR, minimum and maximum daily above-ground temperature, and minimum and maximum daily soil temperature as response variables. We included target temperature treatment (or measured temperature, for those studies that did not have explicit target temperatures) as a predictor (i.e., a fixed effect). Random effects were site and study year nested within site (with random slopes and intercepts, Tables \ref{table:dtrtemp} \& \ref{table:sdtrtemp}). 

\subsection* {Analysis of effects of time and space on experimental microclimate}
To test how treatment effects vary spatially (i.e., among blocks within a study) and temporally (i.e., among years within a study), we used data from the four studies in the MC3E database that used blocked designs. These studies included infrared (n=5), and soil cable (n=1) warming types.  We fit linear mixed-effect models with mean daily soil temperature, minimum daily air temperature, and maximum daily air temperature as response variables (Figure 4 in the main text). For temporal models, we included fixed effects of temperature treatment, year, and their interaction; random effects were site and block nested within site (intercept-only structure, Table \ref{table:blocks_time}). For spatial models, we included fixed effects of temperature treatment, block, and their interaction; random effects were site and year nested within site (intercept-only structure, Table \ref{table:blocks_space}). Both of these models excluded data from plots with precipitation treatments. 
\subsection* {Analysis of effects of infrastructure on experimental microclimate}
To test how infrastructure affects microclimate, we compared temperature and soil moisture data from the studies in the MC3E database that monitored climate in two types of control plots: structural controls (i.e., `shams' or `disturbance controls,'which contained all the warming infrastructure, such as soil cables or forced air chambers with no heat applied) and ambient controls with no infrastructure added. These five studies consisted of soil cables (exp08), forced air (exp07, exp10), and combined soil and forced air (exp03, exp04) warming types (all with feedback control) and occurred at two sites: Duke Forest and Harvard Forest \citep{farnsworth1995,clark2014a,marchin2015,pelini2011}. One additional study, exp15, which utilized forced air, monitored environmental conditions in both ambient and structural controls, but we were only able to obtain data for the ambient controls so it is excluded from this analysis. Note that all studies that employ forced air warming utilize chambers, whereas the other warming types did not utilize chambers.
\par For experiments using infrared heating, we were unable to directly compare ambient and structural controls because no studies in our database included and shared data from both control types. Instead, we compared differences between each control type (ambient versus structural) and the measured amount of warming per degree of target warming in experimental plots. We predicted that, if heating infrastructure affects microclimate, the measured amount of warming per degree of target warming should differ by control type. Of the seven infrared sites in our database that measured soil temperature, three used ambient controls (exp06, exp11, exp14) and four used structural controls (exp01, exp09, exp12, exp13). (Two studies used feedback control [exp01, exp09]; five studies used constant warming control [exp06, exp11, exp12, exp13, exp14].) Among these studies, warming per \degree C of target warming was 1.01\degree C for structural controls (SE= 0.09, Table  \ref{table:infrared}), but significantly lower for ambient controls (0.41\degree C of warming per \degree C of target warming, SE=0.09, Table \ref{table:infrared}). This trend, based on a limited number of studies and sites, suggests that infrared heating equipment may alter microclimate, likely by shading the soil surface \citep{mcdaniel2014}.  

\par For studies for which we were able to directly compare ambient and structural controls, we fit linear mixed-effects models by month for the following response variables: mean daily soil temperature, minimum and maximum daily air and soil temperature (\citet{farnsworth1995} only measured mean soil, so there are only four different studies in models for minimum and maximum air and soil), and soil moisture. The predictor was control type (sham or ambient). To allow for both mean differences in temperature and the effect of control to to vary among sites and years, random effects were site and year nested within site, modeled as random slopes and random intercepts. 
We found that experimental structures altered above-ground and soil temperatures in opposing ways: above-ground temperatures were higher in the structural controls, compared with ambient conditions with no structures installed, whereas soil temperatures were lower in the structural controls compared with ambient soil (Figure 4 in the main text).  In addition, soil moisture was lower in structural controls compared with ambient conditions. These general patterns were consistent across the different temperature models we fit (mean, minimum, and maximum soil and air temperatures), although the magnitude varied across months, as well as among studies. We show summaries from models fit to the entire year (Tables \ref{table:shamamb_soiltemp}, \ref{table:shamamb_airtemp}, \ref{table:shamamb_soilmois}), as well as summaries from models fit to each month of data, is shown in Figure 4 in the main text (Tables \ref{table:shamamb_stempm}, \ref{table:shamamb_atempm}, \ref{table:shamamb_soilmoism}).


\subsection* {Analysis of effects of precipitation treatments on above-ground temperature}
Of the 15 experiments in the MC3E database, five manipulated precipitation and measured above-ground temperature and three of these also measured soil temperature (all used infrared warming, with one constant wattage and two feedback control). To examine the effects of precipitation treatment on temperature, we fit linear mixed-effects models to data from these sites with temperature (above-ground daily minimum and maximum, and soil minimum and maximum) as the response variables. Predictors were precipitation treatment (a continuous fixed effect, which ranged from 50 to 200\% of ambient for these four studies), target warming (a continuous fixed effect, which ranged from 0 to 4 \degree C for these three studies), and their interaction. To account for methodological and other differences among sites, we included site as a random effect, with year and doy nested within site to account for the non-independent nature of measurements taken on the same day within sites. We used a random intercept model structure (Table \ref{table:preciptemp}). 

\subsection* {Analysis of effects of experimental warming on soil moisture}
Of the 15 experiments in the MC3E database, 12 measured and reported soil moisture. These studies included infrared with feedback control (n=2), infrared with constant energy output (n=5), forced air with feedback control (n=3), and combined forced air and soil cable with feedback control (n=2) warming types. To examine the effects of target warming treatment on soil moisture, we fit linear mixed-effects models to data from these ten sites, excluding plots with precipitation treatments. We first fit a model with soil moisture as the response and a predictor of target warming (a continuous fixed effect, which ranged from 0 to 5.5 \degree C for these 12 studies). To account for differences among warming types, we included warming type as a fixed effect, grouping all infrared types together and grouping combined forced air/soil cable warming type with forced air studies because of the low sample sizes. We accounted for other differences among studies by including site as a random effect, with year and doy nested within site to account for the non-independent nature of measurements taken on the same day within sites.  We used a random intercept model structure (Table \ref{table:targsoilmois}). 

\par In addition to testing how experimental warming influenced soil moisture, we also tested how experimental structures influenced soil moisture. We compared the soil moisture measured in structural controls to both ambient controls and warmed plots by fitting a model with categorical fixed effects of ``ambient," ``structural control," and ``warmed."  We again included warming type as a fixed effect, and site as a random effect, with doy nested within site to account for the non-independent nature of measurements taken on the same day within sites, and used a random intercept structure (Table \ref{table:warmsoilmois}). 

\subsection* {Analysis of budburst phenology}
We wanted to investigate how using measured plot-level climate variables, as opposed to target warming, alters estimates of temperature sensitivity in ecology. To do this, we fit two different types of models to data from the five study sites in the MC3E database that recorded above-ground temperature and soil moisture, as well as phenology data (doy of budburst). These studies included infrared (n=1), forced air (n=2), and combined forced air and soil cable (n=2) warming types. (All of these studies used feedback control). We used only structural controls in the reported analysis, because this is the type of control that all five studies possess (including ambient control plots in the analysis did not qualitatively change the results). We focus on budburst, as this phenological phase was reported most commonly among studies in the MC3E database. For all models, we accounted for non-independence by including species, site, and year nested within site as intercept-only random effects (Table \ref{table:bbmods}). The target warming model included only one explanatory variable (the target amount of warming).  We compared this to models with mean annual measured above-ground temperature (offset by subtracting the minimum temperature across all studies and plots, to make model intercepts more similar), mean winter (January-March) soil moisture, and their interaction as explanatory variables. The slope for temperature in the measured climate model can be directly compared to the slope for target warming in the target warming model because the units are the same (change in budburst, in days, per\degree C).
\par To determine which specific above-ground temperature variable to include in the measured climate model, we compared AICs of models for with four different temperature variables (mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures, mean January-March minimum and maximum temperatures). The model with mean annual minimum temperature, mean January-March soil moisture, and their interaction provided the best model fit (lowest AIC, highest explained variation, Table \ref{table:bbaic}), so we discuss and interpret that model in the main text, summarize it in Table \ref{table:bbmods}, and present its coefficients in Figure 7.

(For three studies [exp06, exp11, exp12] there was no explicit target temperature so reported warming was used.) Two studies used feedback control (exp01, exp09); five studies used constant warming control (exp06, exp11, exp12, exp13, exp14). Tdiff was calculated by substracting mean annual temperature in control plots from mean annual temperature each treatment level among controls, and in seven infrared studies that measured above-ground warming (including canopy, surface, and air temperature). We divided Tdiff by the target warming for the treatment level, to standardize across studies. We then fit a mixed-effects model with Tdiff as the response, control type (structural or ambient) as the predictor, and random effects of site (n=7) and year nested within site (24 year-site combinations), with an intercept-only structure. We list the estimated Tdiff and its standard error (se) for each control type.  Tdiff differed significantly across the two control types, based on Type II Wald $\chi^{2}$ tests of the fixed effects ($\chi^{2}$=19.71 , df=1, p<0.001). Total number of observations was 37.}

\caption{\textbf{Summary of a linear mixed-effects model comparing soil moisture (\% VWC)} in climate change experiments with different types of active warming and in experimentally warmed plots to two different control types, structural and ambient controls. We excluded data from plots with precipitation treatments from this analysis. Warming types included infrared with feedback control (exp01, exp09), infrared with constant warming (exp05, exp12, exp13, exp14), forced air (exp07, exp10), and combined soil and forced air (exp03, exp04), all with feedback control.  All infrared types were pooled, and forced air plots were pooled with combined forced air and warming.  Estimates (est.) are the intercept (representing ambient controls in infrared plots) and coefficient (i.e. differences between the ambient for structural controls of different warming types) for structural controls and warmed plots (pooled across all target warming levels); se is the standard error for these estimates. There were significant differences among control types (structural versus ambient), based on Type II Wald $\chi^{2}$ tests of the fixed effect ($\chi^{2}$=7962.77, df=2, p<0.001). There was also a significant interaction between control type and warming type (forced air versus infrared; $\chi^{2}$=718.45, df=2, p<0.001). Random effects were site (n=11), year nested within site (n=44 site-year combinations), and doy nested within year (8,894 doy-year-site combinations) with a random intercept structure.
