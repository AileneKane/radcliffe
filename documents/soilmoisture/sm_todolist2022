##Soil Moisture Analyses To Do List 2022##
##########################################

# 1. Changes to Figures in Main text	
	-Move model figure to supplement- subset species to show only most common
	-Map of sites
# 2. Figures to make
	-plot intercept vs slope of species as this would suggest differences of early vs late
	-GDD models -Include as a sentence (We found the same trends), and add figures to support	-present as fairly consistent with main models and just as a sentence or so


# 3. Make tables for all models in supplement- 
	-add number of sites per model to table
	
# 4. Make a map of study sites for supp

# 5. Review recent papers published on soil moisture and phenology
 
# 6. Plots of (mean?) soil moisture and temperature by site, year, phenophase for supp

# 7. Send to co-authors!

# 8. Post ExPhen database to knb 


Figures for Ailene to make
1) Correlations between moisture and temperature from what goes into model
2) Pull out species by ecosystem (grasses vs forests) and look at effects of sm and temp
3) Intercept vs slope of species-done

Notes
Add to discussion variance of random effects (species, site, year comparisons)

Make more clear this main message: Wetter soils cause earlier phenology temperate ecosystems

Add to results- make more clear the finding that moisture effect is present for all three phone phases.
