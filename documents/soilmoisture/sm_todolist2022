##Soil Moisture Analyses To Do List 2022##
##########################################

# 1. Changes to Figures in Main text	
	-Move model figure to supplement- subset species to show only most common
	-Map of sites
#

# 3. Make tables for all models in supplement- 
	-add number of sites per model to table
	
# 4. Make a map of study sites for supp

 
# 6. Plots of (mean?) soil moisture and temperature by site, year, phenophase for supp

# 7. Send to co-authors!

# 8. Post ExPhen database to knb 



Notes
Add to discussion variance of random effects (species, site, year comparisons)

Make more clear this main message: Wetter soils cause earlier phenology in temperate ecosystems

Add to results- make more clear the finding that moisture effect is present for all three phenophases.
