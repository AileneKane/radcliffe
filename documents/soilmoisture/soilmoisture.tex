%\textbf{Statement of authorship} %Statement of authorship: Contributions by authors should be listed on the title page and will be printed at the end of the manuscript. This statement should be appropriate to the study described in the manuscript and should clarify who designed the study, who performed the research, who provided new methods or materials, and who wrote the manuscript. We encourage concise statements such as ?JW performed phylogenetic analyses, MH collected data, performed modeling work and analyzed output data, and PK performed the meta-analysis. MH wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and all authors contributed substantially to revisions.?
%All authors conceived of this manuscript, which was inspired by our discussions at a Radcliffe Exploratory Seminar in 2016, and all authors contributed to manuscript revisions. AKE and EMW conceived of the idea for the literature review, database compilation, and related Radcliffe Exploratory Seminar. AKE compiled the datasets; AKE analyzed the data and created the figures; AKE wrote the manuscript.

%\textbf{Data Accessibility} %Data accessibility statement: The statement must confirm that, should the manuscript be accepted, the data supporting the results will be archived in an appropriate public repository such as Dryad or Figshare and the data DOI will be included at the end of the article.
%The MC3E database will be available at KNB \citep{ettinger2018}, along with all R code from the analyses included in this paper. (Currently, metadata are published there; the full database and R code are available to reviewers on github.)

\section*{Question/goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{How does soil moisture affect phenology?}
\item{Does the effect of soil moisture on phenology differ between experiments and observational data?}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Approach}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Compile phenology data that goes with climate data in MC3E database. (Name this database!)}
\item{Fit models with soil moisture, temperature, and interaction to phenology data (budburst, leafout, flowering, fruiting, senesence? (See what phenophases have enough data.)}
\item{Compile Duke and Harvard Forest phenology and climate data.}
\item{Fit models to observational data with microclimate and compare coefficients.}

 \caption{\textbf{Deviations in daily observed warming from mean control soil temperature for 12 study sites,} excluding data from plots that manipulated precipitation. We show soil, rather than above-ground, temperature, as this was the most frequently recorded temperature variable in the MC3E database. Solid lines show observed difference between warming treatment (colors) and control (black) plots, averaged across replicates and years; shading shows 95\% confidence intervals. Dashed lines represent target warming levels. (Note that the following studies had no explicit target temperature: exp06, exp11, exp12; for these studies, we used their reported level of warming.) Two sites not shown here did not monitor soil temperature. Experimental sites are ordered by low to high mean annual soil temperature (shown in the upper right corner of each panel). The heating type is listed in parentheses next to the site number (IR= infrared, soil= soil cables, air= forced air).} %The number of temperature treatment levels vary from one (e.g. exp08, exp11) to nine (exp07 and exp10, which used an unreplicated regression design). Daily temperature values were obtained by averaging across years for each day of the year in each temperature treatment in each study.
