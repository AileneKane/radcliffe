##Soil Moisture Questions & To Do List 2023##
#############################################
#MAr 22, 2023 meeting
# 1. Table of exps: include only studies analyzed or full suite to make exclusion more clear?

# 2. Reporting interactions on natural scale?

# 3. Check uncentered models for number of chains and rerun as necessary.

#4. Refs about phenology-relevant traits associated with soil moisture differences? other ref linking traits to phenology?

#5. Find ref documenting problem with using preceiptation or proxy for soil moisture



# 1. Changes to Figures in Main text	
	-Move model figure to supplement- subset species to show only most common
	-Map of sites
#

# 3. Make tables for all models in supplement- 
	-add number of sites per model to table
	
# 4. Make a map of study sites for supp

 
# 6. Plots of (mean?) soil moisture and temperature by site, year, phenophase for supp

# 7. Post ExPhen database to knb 



Notes
Add to discussion variance of random effects (species, site, year comparisons)

Make more clear this main message: Wetter soils cause earlier phenology in temperate ecosystems

Add to results- make more clear the finding that moisture effect is present for all three phenophases.
