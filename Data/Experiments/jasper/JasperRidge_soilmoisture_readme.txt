Jasper Ridge soil moisture measurements

All of these measurements are made with TDR and integrate from 0-30 cm depth.
In the 1998-2000 file, NOV1DAY is days since 11/1/1998 (11/1/1998 = day 1).

In the 2001 file, "dateav" is a standardized date "average" of dates when a round of measurements was taken, if that round of measurements went across multiple days.

Note that the growing season in this region of California starts in October or so, with the first rains of the season -- onset of plant growth is not temperature-dependent.
