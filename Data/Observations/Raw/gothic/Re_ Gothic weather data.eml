Not that i can think of.  It is just that i have put a lot of effort into
this and so want to know what is being done with it, which is why i do not
want it used (outside of what is on-line, and i am adding to that daily)
without knowing about it.  So really, just use it for your needs but
nothing else (useless you pick, for example,  3 years high temperatures and
play the lottery with those numbers and win- then i get half).  billy
