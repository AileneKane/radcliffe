@article{Dorji2013,
	abstract = {{Global climate change is predicted to have large impacts on the
   phenology and reproduction of alpine plants, which will have important
   implications for plant demography and community interactions, trophic
   dynamics, ecosystem energy balance, and human livelihoods. In this
   article we report results of a 3-year, fully factorial experimental
   study exploring how warming, snow addition, and their combination affect
   reproductive phenology, effort, and success of four alpine plant species
   belonging to three different life forms in a semiarid, alpine meadow
   ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that
   warming and snow addition change reproductive phenology and success, but
   responses are not uniform across species. Moreover, traits associated
   with resource acquisition, such as rooting depth and life history (early
   vs. late flowering), mediate plant phenology, and reproductive responses
   to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, we found that warming
   delayed the reproductive phenology and decreased number of
   inflorescences of Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke, a shallow-rooted,
   early-flowering plant, which may be mainly constrained by upper-soil
   moisture availability. Because K. pygmaea is the dominant species in the
   alpine meadow ecosystem, these results may have important implications
   for ecosystem dynamics and for pastoralists and wildlife in the region.}},
