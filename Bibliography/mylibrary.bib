	Abstract = {Uses of long-term ecological proxies in strategies for mitigating future biodiversity loss are too limited in scope. Recent advances in geochronological dating, palaeoclimate reconstructions and molecular techniques for inferring population dynamics offer exciting new prospects for using retrospective knowledge to better forecast and manage ecological outcomes in the face of global change. Opportunities include using fossils, genes and computational models to identify ecological traits that caused species to be differentially prone to regional and range-wide extinction, test if threatened-species assessment approaches work and locate habitats that support stable ecosystems in the face of shifting climates. These long-term retrospective analyses will improve efforts to predict the likely effects of future climate and other environmental change on biodiversity, and target conservation management resources most effectively.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the relative roles of climate and species interactions in regulating population dynamics, one of the oldest challenges in ecology, is now a prerequisite for predicting species responses to climate change. A lack of case studies limits our ability to generalize about the factors that have regulated populations in the past and will be important in the future. Here, we take a first step toward identifying the drivers of plant population dynamics by studying the influence of climate and species interactions on the recruitment and survival of ten forb species from a Kansas ( USA) prairie. Combining a long-term demographic data set with a Bayesian hierarchical-modeling approach, we fit models in which annual survival and recruitment rates are driven by precipitation, temperature, and species composition. Although the effects of these covariates differed among species, three general patterns emerged. First, climate had a greater influence than species composition on historical population dynamics. Second, forecasted increases in mean temperatures are likely to impact the population growth of these species more than future changes in precipitation or composition. Third, the significant effects of both climate and species composition on recruitment suggest that range expansions will be particularly difficult to forecast. Based on these patterns, we recommend field experiments to evaluate the ability of plant species to recruit at expanding range margins under warmer temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

@article{RefWorks:517,
	Abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variation in fall cold hardiness was studied in two western Oregon breeding populations df coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) France), one on the west slope of the Cascade Mountains and the other in the Coast Range. On six sampling dates (September, October, and November of 1992 and January, September, and October of 1993), shoot cuttings from 40 open-pollinated families in each of two progeny test sites for each breeding zone were subjected to artificial freezing at two test temperatures. Damage on each shoot was recorded as visible injury to needle, stem, and bud tissues separately. Considerable family variation was found for cold injury scores in all tissues in early fall to midfall, but differences were often smaller or nonsignificant in late fall and midwinter. Individual heritability estimates for needle cold injury were low (<0.40) and generally decreased in late fall and midwinter. Family rankings for fall cold hardiness, however, are expected to be relatively consistent over sites and years, although needles appear to display more family-by-site interaction than stems or buds. Genetic correlations between tissues in cold injury varied considerably and were sometimes weak, indicating that the evaluation of a single tissue is probably not adequate for assessing overall cold hardiness of genotypes. Fall and winter cold hardiness seem to be largely under separate genetic control since genetic correlations between hardiness at these two stages were weak. This study confirms earlier results in Washington breeding populations and shows that coastal Douglas-fir families can be effectively ranked for fall cold hardiness by conducting artificial freeze tests on cut shoots in midfall (October) and scoring damage to stems and at least one other tissue.},

	Abstract = {In the Central Greater Caucasus Mountains, Georgia, Betula litwinowii (birch) occurs on north-facing slopes of east-west ridgelines that extend upward to high mountain peaks, forms the alpine timberline at higher elevation, and reaches its highest treeline limit only when associated with the broadleaf evergreen shrub, Rhododendron caucasicum. This association might generate an ecological facilitation of either temperatures or sky exposure, both of which have been related to the altitudes at which timberlines/treelines occur. At the lowest site (2072 m) the greatest abundance of birch seedlings (up to 2.3 seedlings/m(2)) occurred at shaded microsites beneath the B. litwinowii overstory and along shaded north-facing walls of polyhedral soil depressions just beyond this treeline. These seedling microsites also had substantially colder air and soil temperature regimes than more sun-exposed microsites. Similarly, at the highest elevation site (2512 m) the second greatest seedling abundance (0.73 seedlings/m(2)) occurred in the shaded understory beneath R. caucasicum. Moreover, these microsites had the coldest minimum air and soil temperatures (-1.3 degrees C at 5 cm depths), along with the greatest number of days (40) with minimum soil temperatures < 5 degrees C recorded for the measurement period (11 July to 25 October 2003). In addition to the lowest number of seedlings, the more sun-exposed microsites at all sites also had the greatest percent (28-32%) of red leaves per plant, indicative of high concentrations of photoprotective anthocyanins. Thus, reduced sky exposure, and not cold temperature effects, was associated with greater seedling abundance and fewer red leaves per seedling, despite colder temperature regimes. Thus, facilitation of B. litwinowii seedling establishment by the R. caucasicum overstory appeared to extend the maximum altitude of the Betula treeline via reductions in sunlight exposure, despite lower temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary responses are required for tree populations to be able to track climate change. Results of 250years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.},

	Abstract = {In coming decades, global climate changes are expected to produce large shifts in vegetation distributions at unprecedented rates. These shifts are expected to be most rapid and extreme at ecotones, the boundaries between ecosystems, particularly those in semiarid landscapes. However, current models do not adequately provide for such rapid effects-particularly those caused by mortality-largely because of the lack of data from field studies. Here we report the most rapid landscape-scale shift of a woody ecotone ever documented: in northern New Mexico in the 1950s, the ecotone between semiarid ponderosa pine forest and pinon-juniper woodland shifted extensively (2 km or more) and rapidly (<5 years) through mortality of ponderosa pines in response to a severe drought. This shift has persisted for 40 years. Forest patches within the shift zone became much more fragmented, and soil erosion greatly accelerated. The rapidity and the complex dynamics of the persistent shift point to the need to represent more accurately these dynamics, especially the mortality factor, in assessments of the effects of climate change.},

	Abstract = {Changes in phenology are correlated with climate change. However, we still struggle to understand the traits making species susceptible to climate change, and the implications of species' reactions for communities and food webs. Butterflies and moths are an ecologically important group that have shown pronounced phenological changes over the last decades. Tests using a > 150-year dataset from 566 European butterfly and moth species demonstrated that variation in phenological change was strongly related to traits describing plant-herbivore interactions (larval diet breadth, diet composition), and the life cycle. The results indicate that climate change related shifts in phenology are correlated with the seasonal availability and palatability of food plants. Lepidopterans feeding on herbaceous plants showed smaller shifts in flight periods but larger increases in voltinism than lepidopterans feeding on woody plants. Consequently, the effect of herbivorous lepidopterans may increase in herb-rich grassland ecosystems under warmer conditions, and not in forest ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter the spatial distributions of species and habitat types but the nature of such change is uncertain. Thus, climate change makes it difficult to implement standard conservation planning paradigms. Previous work has suggested some approaches to cope with such uncertainty but has not harnessed all of the benefits of risk diversification. We adapt Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimal spatial targeting of conservation activity, using wetland habitat conservation in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) as an example. This approach finds the allocations of conservation activity among subregions of the planning area that maximize the expected conservation returns for a given level of uncertainty or minimize uncertainty for a given expected level of returns. We find that using MPT instead of simple diversification in the PPR can achieve a value of the conservation objective per dollar spent that is 15% higher for the same level of risk. MPT-based portfolios can also have 21% less uncertainty over benefits or 6% greater expected benefits than the current portfolio of PPR conservation. Total benefits from conservation investment are higher if returns are defined in terms of benefit-cost ratios rather than benefits alone. MPT-guided diversification can work to reduce the climate-change-induced uncertainty of future ecosystem-service benefits from many land policy and investment initiatives, especially when outcomes are negatively correlated between subregions of a planning area.},

	Abstract = {Every species occupies a limited geographic area, but how spatiotemporal environmental variation affects individual and population fitness to create range limits is not well understood. Because range boundaries arise where, on average, populations are more likely to go extinct than to persist, range limits are an inherently population-level problem for which a demographic framework is useful. In this study, I compare demographic parameters and population dynamics between central and marginal populations of monkey flowers, Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii, along an elevation gradient spanning both species' ranges. Central and marginal populations of both species differed in survival and fecundity. For M. lewisii, these components of fitness were higher in central than in marginal populations, but for M. cardinalis the converse was true. To assess spatiotemporal variation in population dynamics, I used transition matrix models to estimate asymptotic population growth rates ( lambda) and found that population growth rates of M. lewisii were highest at the range center and reduced at the range margin. Population growth rates of M. cardinalis were highest at the range margin and greatly reduced at the range center. Life table response analysis decomposed spatiotemporal variation in lambda into contributions from each transition between life stages, finding that transitions from large nonreproductive and reproductive plants to the seed class and stasis in the reproductive class made the largest contributions to spatial differences in lambda. These transitions had only low to moderate sensitivities, indicating that differences in projected population growth rates resulted mainly from observed differences in transition matrix parameters and their underlying vital rates.},

	Abstract = {Every species is limited both geographically and ecologically to a subset of available habitats, yet for many species the causes of distribution limits are unknown. Temperature is thought to be one of the primary determinants of species distributions along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. This study examined leaf physiology and plant performance under contrasting temperature regimes of sister species of monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis and Mimulus lewisii (Phrymaceae), that differ in altitude distribution to test the hypothesis that temperature is the primary determinant of differences in fitness versus altitude. Each species attained greatest above-ground biomass, net photosynthetic rate, and effective quantum yield of photosystem 11 when grown under temperatures characteristic of the altitudinal range center. Although both species exhibited greater stem length, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration in hot than in cold temperatures, these traits showed much greater reductions under cold temperature for M. cardinalis than for M. lewisii. Survival of M. lewisii was also sensitive to temperature, showing a striking decrease in hot temperatures. Within each temperature regime, the species native to that temperature displayed greatest growth and leaf physiological capacity. Populations from the altitude range center and range margin of each species were used to examine population differentiation, but central and marginal populations did not differ in most growth or leaf physiological responses to temperature. This study provides evidence that M. cardinalis and M. lewisii differ in survival, growth, and leaf physiology under temperature regimes characterizing their contrasting low and high altitude range centers, and suggests that the species' altitude range limits may arise, in part, due to metabolic limitations on growth that ultimately decrease survival and limit reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Determining how species' geographic ranges are governed by current climates and how they will respond to rapid climatic change poses a major biological challenge. Geographic ranges are often spatially fragmented and composed of genetically differentiated populations that are locally adapted to different thermal regimes. Tradeoffs between different aspects of thermal performance, such as between tolerance to high temperature and tolerance to low temperature or between maximal performance and breadth of performance, suggest that the performance of a given population will be a subset of that of the species. Therefore, species-level projections of distribution might overestimate the species' ability to persist at any given location. However, current approaches to modeling distributions often do not consider variation among populations. Here, we estimated genetically-based differences in thermal performance curves for growth among 12 populations of the scarlet monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis, a perennial herb of western North America. We inferred the maximum relative growth rate (RGR(max)), temperature optimum (T(opt)), and temperature breadth (T(breadth)) for each population. We used these data to test for tradeoffs in thermal performance, generate mechanistic population-level projections of distribution under current and future climates, and examine how variation in aspects of thermal performance influences forecasts of range shifts. Populations differed significantly in RGR(max) and had variable, but overlapping, estimates of T(opt) and T(breadth). T(opt) declined with latitude and increased with temperature of origin, consistent with tradeoffs between performances at low temperatures versus those at high temperatures. Further, T(breadth) was negatively related to RGR(max), as expected for a specialist-generalist tradeoff. Parameters of the thermal performance curve influenced properties of projected distributions. For both current and future climates, T(opt) was negatively related to latitudinal position, while T(breadth) was positively related to projected range size. The magnitude and direction of range shifts also varied with T(opt) and T(breadth), but sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the fraction of habitat remaining suitable increased with T(opt) but decreased with T(breadth). Northern limits of all populations were projected to shift north, but the magnitude of shift decreased with T(opt) and increased with T(breadth). Median latitude was projected to shift north for populations with high T(breadth) and low T(opt), but south for populations with low T(breadth) and high T(opt). Distributions inferred by integrating population-level projections did not differ from a species-level projection that ignored variation among populations. However, the species-level approach masked the potential array of divergent responses by populations that might lead to genotypic sorting within the species' range. Thermal performance tradeoffs among populations within the species' range had important, but sometimes counterintuitive, effects on projected responses to climatic change.},

	Abstract = {Question: What ecological and evolutionary processes are important in maintaining parapatric distributions of sibling species? Hypotheses: Previous research has suggested that competition is a likely factor limiting species distributions and maintaining parapatric distributions. Alternatively, abiotic restrictions such as climatic factors and local adaptation can also limit species' ranges. Organisms: Plethodon hubrichti, a mountaintop endemic salamander, has an extremely limited geographic range that is entirely surrounded by the widespread Plethodon cinereus. Previous studies have suggested that P. hubrichti may be geographically restricted as a result of interspecific competition with P. cinereus. Methods: We studied the relationship between trophic morphology and diet in allopatric and sympatric populations to examine the effect of exploitative competition on geographic distribution. Behavioural experiments were conducted in the laboratory to determine the effects of interference competition. We complemented these analyses with bioclimatic modelling of species' ranges and climate-phenotype correlations to examine the abiotic impact. Results: Our results suggest that aggressive interactions with P hubrichti restrict the distribution of P cinereus and not the converse, whereas P hubrichti appears to be limited by abiotic climatic factors.},

Although it is often stated in the literature that the deleterious effects of inbreeding ( inbreeding depression) are expected to be more pronounced under stressful than benign conditions, this issue remains unresolved and controversial. We review the current literature on the relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression and environmental stress and calculate haploid lethal equivalents expressed under relatively benign and stressful conditions based on data from 34 studies. Inbreeding depression increases under stress in 76% of cases, although this increase is only significant in 48% of the studies considered. Estimates of lethal equivalents are significantly greater under stressful (mean = 1.45, median = 1.02) than relatively benign ( mean 0.85, median = 0.61) conditions. This amounts to an approximately 69% increase in inbreeding depression in a stressful vs a benign environment. However, we find strong lineage effects to be ubiquitous among studies that examine inbreeding depression in multiple environments, and a prevalence of conditionally expressed deleterious effects within lineages that are uncorrelated across environments. These results have important implications for both evolutionary and conservation biology.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the genetic composition and mating systems of edge populations provides important insights into the environmental and demographic factors shaping species' distribution ranges. We analysed samples of the mangrove Avicennia marina from Vietnam, northern Philippines and Australia, with microsatellite markers. We compared genetic diversity and structure in edge (Southeast Asia, and Southern Australia) and core (North and Eastern Australia) populations, and also compared our results with previously published data from core and southern edge populations. Comparisons highlighted significantly reduced gene diversity and higher genetic structure in both margins compared to core populations, which can be attributed to very low effective population size, pollinator scarcity and high environmental pressure at distribution margins. The estimated level of inbreeding was significantly higher in northeastern populations compared to core and southern populations. This suggests that despite the high genetic load usually associated with inbreeding, inbreeding or even selfing may be advantageous in margin habitats due to the possible advantages of reproductive assurance, or local adaptation. The very high level of genetic structure and inbreeding show that populations of A. marina are functioning as independent evolutionary units more than as components of a metapopulation system connected by gene flow. The combinations of those characteristics make these peripheral populations likely to develop local adaptations and therefore to be of particular interest for conservation strategies as well as for adaptation to possible future environmental changes.},

	Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in spring onset are identified across western North America using a spring index (SI) model based on weather station minimum and maximum temperatures (T(min) and T(max), respectively). Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However, these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead, over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950-2005), the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM, which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10-20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of about -1.5 days decade(-1) from 1950 to 2005. Trends in the NAM and PNA can only explain about one-third (-0.5 day decade(-1)) of this trend.},

In line with allozyme studies, inbreeders showed more partitioning of diversity among populations, and diversity in selfing taxa was lower than expected from reductions in effective population size due to selfing alone, suggesting the presence of either population bottlenecks or background selection in selfers. Evaluation of the stepwise mutation model (a model of DNA replication slippage) suggests that these loci evolve in a stepwise fashion. Inferred coalescent times of microsatellite alleles indicate that past bottlenecks of population size or colonization events were important in reducing diversity in the inbreeding taxon.},

	Abstract = {Recent evolutionary models of range limits emphasize the importance of ecological and demographic factors operating at species' margins. This study aims to establish the ecological context driving population boundaries in Gilia tricolor, a native California annual restricted to distinct habitat patches in the coastal range of California. A transplant experiment in one hillside G. tricolor population examined the roles of competition and soil chemistry as well as litter and biomass accumulation in setting local population boundaries. Results indicate that boundaries are maintained primarily by inhibition of seedling emergence by vegetation and litter, and that upslope and downslope population boundaries are heterogeneous in litter biomass and transplant performance. Consistent emergence inhibition in undisturbed, peripheral sites maintains limits to the distribution of G. tricolor in this population. Fine-scaled ecological heterogeneity and heterogeneous boundary conditions likely play important roles in limiting adaptation and subsequent range expansion at population boundaries in G. tricolor.},

	Abstract = {In the 25 yrs since the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act was passed, substantial agreement has been reached about how to manage single-species fisheries in the U.S. Biological reference points, such as the biomass that will produce maximum sustained fisheries yield, are estimated from fairly standardized kinds of fisheries models, and management regulations such as quotas are set according to control rules based on these reference points. Debate about the specifics of single-species fisheries management takes place within this basic framework. However, the objectives, principles, goals, and scientific methodology of ecosystem-based management are in an early stage of development, and no standardized approach currently exists. Ecosystem-based management regimes may run the gamut from a suite of single-species reference points to that based on reference points that measure some level of ecosystem function (e.g., measures of biodiversity). Management regimes that do not rely upon quantitative reference points, such as systems of marine protected areas, gear restrictions, or community-based management, have also been referred to as ecosystem-based management. Inclusion of ecosystem values such as biodiversity and ecosystem function in fisheries management under U.S. fisheries law will require evolution of consensus toward a standardized, practical approach to ecosystem-based management.},

	Abstract = {Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how Much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated: (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state: (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity accrding to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.

We estimate the management costs of two different protection scenarios within a large proposed MPA, the Coral Sea in Australia. We use three methods to estimate costs: an existing model of global MPA management costs; a new statistical model based on Australian MPA management costs; and expert estimates that extrapolate from the adjacent Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Both the new statistical model and expert estimates were relevant to both protection scenarios and indicate that a single large no-take reserve is less expensive to manage than a multiple-use MPA of the same area with a 30% no-take component. Expenses associated with compliance drive the difference in management cost between scenarios. Estimating management costs of MPA scenarios adds an important, though still challenging, financial perspective to MPA design.},

	Abstract = {Background: The often dramatic effects of urbanization on community and ecosystem properties, such as primary productivity, abundances, and diversity are now well-established. In most cities local primary productivity increases and this extra energy flows upwards to alter diversity and relative abundances in higher trophic levels. The abiotic mechanisms thought to be responsible for increases in urban productivity are altered temperatures and light regimes, and increased nutrient and water inputs. However, another abiotic factor, wind speed, is also influenced by urbanization and well known for altering primary productivity in agricultural systems. Wind effects on primary productivity have heretofore not been studied in the context of urbanization. Methodology/Principal Findings: We designed a field experiment to test if increased plant growth often observed in cities is explained by the sheltering effects of built structures. Wind speed was reduced by protecting Encelia farinosa (brittlebush) plants in urban, desert remnant and outlying desert localities via windbreaks while controlling for water availability and nutrient content. In all three habitats, we compared E. farinosa growth when protected by experimental windbreaks and in the open. E. farinosa plants protected against ambient wind in the desert and remnant areas grew faster in terms of biomass and height than exposed plants. As predicted, sheltered plants did not differ from unprotected plants in urban areas where wind speed is already reduced. Conclusion/Significance: Our results indicate that reductions in wind speed due to built structures in cities contribute to increased plant productivity and thus also to changes in abundances and diversity of higher trophic levels. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate wind speed in future urban ecological studies, as well as in planning for green space and sustainable cities.},

On an Abies amabilis sapling located in the understory at the base of one of the study trees, predawn and solar noon xylem pressure potentials were also measured. Xylem pressure potential data were measured from late June through early September 1996 on foliage sampled from 1 to 64.5 m, Over this height gradient, predawn water potentials ranged from -0.23 to -1.10 MPa. Solar noon values showed an even greater range (from -0.44 to -2.51 MPa). At predawn, the water potential gradient approached the theoretical hydrostatic gradient (-0.0105 vs -0.010 MPa m(-1)). The gradient at solar noon was steeper (-0.0331 MPa m(-1)). Instantaneous stomatal conductances were not greatly different between young, sapling-sized and old-growth trees [0.091+/-0.033 (SD) vs 0.086+/-0.045 cm s(-1), respectively]. Stomata of both size classes of trees appeared very sensitive to increasing vapor pressure deficits, a comparison of stable carbon isotope values from the old-growth and sapling-sized trees indicated lower stomatal conductances in the old-growth. This study provides sound documentation regarding the utility of the cohesion theory in the interpretation of water potential gradients. This study also emphasizes inherent differences between sapling-sized and tall, old-growth trees.},

An increasing number of studies have responded to this challenge by using climate envelopes, modeling the association between climate variables and species distributions. However, it is difficult to quantify how well species actually match climate. Here, we use null models to show that species-climate associations found by climate envelope methods are no better than chance for 68 of 100 European bird species. In line with predictions, we demonstrate that the species with distribution limits determined by climate have more northerly ranges. We conclude that scientific studies and climate change adaptation policies based on the indiscriminate use of climate envelope methods irrespective of species sensitivity to climate may be misleading and in need of revision.},

To achieve this goal, a new research agenda is needed that focuses on: quantifying the ecosystem services provided by fresh waters; quantifying the economic, social and nutritional benefits of inland fisheries; improving assessments designed to evaluate fisheries exploitation potential; and examining feedbacks between fisheries, ecosystem productivity and aquatic biodiversity.

We assign Mazoideae and Phrymoideae to a redefined family Phrymaceae. (3) Mimulus is not monophyletic, because member, of at least six other genera have been derived from within it. In light of the molecular evidence, it is clear that species of Phrymaceae (about 190 species) ha e undergone two geographically distinct radiations; one in western North America (about 130 species) and another in Australia (about 30 species). Phylogenetic interpretations of morphological evolution and biogeographical patterns are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In summer 2003 we recorded the presence and abundance of alien plant species at 232 sites (107 railway stations and 125 road sites) along mountain passes in the Swiss Alps. The altitudinal distribution of species was related to the current abundance of the species in Switzerland and time since introduction. A total of 155 alien taxa were recorded. Numbers of species per site declined exponentially with altitude, and only a few species were found in the alpine zone (> 2000 m). In contrast, species richness among comparable native taxa appeared to be nearly independent of altitude over the range investigated. Maximum altitude reached by alien species was related positively to both total area occupied in Switzerland and to time since introduction. A comparison of the results with earlier records suggests that many species, particularly those previously restricted to low or intermediate altitudes, have advanced their altitudinal limits over the past few decades. Various hypotheses are presented to explain the declining abundance of alien species with altitude: low-altitude filter effects, low propagule pressure, and genetic swamping of peripheral populations at higher altitudes. However, at present we do not have sufficient evidence to determine the relative importance of these effects. We conclude that invasion into mountain areas such as the Swiss Alps tends to proceed rather slowly, though the process may be accelerated by climatic warming. For this reason, further research to investigate the processes determining how plants invade mountain areas is urgently needed. And more generally, investigations into the distribution of alien species along strong altitudinal gradients may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving the spread of alien organisms.

	Abstract = {Sympatric plant species with similar flowering phenologies and floral morphologies may compete for pollination, and as a consequence potentially influence each other's reproductive success and mating system. Two likely competitors are Mimulus ringens and Lobelia siphilitica, which co-occur in wet meadows of central and eastern North America, produce blue zygomorphic flowers, and share several species of bumble bee pollinators. To test for effects of competition for pollination, we planted experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In two arrays we planted mixtures of Mimulus and Lobelia. and in two additional arrays we planted Mimulus without a competitor for pollination. Bumble bee pollinators frequently moved between Mimulus and Lobelia flowers in the mixed-species arrays, with 42% of plant-to-plant movements being interspecific transitions. Pollinator movements between species were associated with a reduction in the amount of conspecific pollen arriving on Mimulus stigmas. The presence of Lobelia led to a significant 37% reduction in the mean number of Mimulus seeds per fruit. In addition, Mimulus had a significantly lower rate of outcrossing in the mixed-species arrays (0.43) than in the "pure" arrays (0.63). This is the first study to demonstrate that competition for pollination directly influences outcrossing rates. Our work suggests that in self-compatible populations with genetic load, competition for pollination may not only reduce seed quantity, but may also lower seed quality.},

	Abstract = {1. The world's population is increasingly urban, and streams and rivers, as the low lying points of the landscape, are especially sensitive to and profoundly impacted by the changes associated with urbanization and suburbanization of catchments. 2. River restoration is an increasingly popular management strategy for improving the physical and ecological conditions of degraded urban streams. In urban catchments, management activities as diverse as stormwater management, bank stabilisation, channel reconfiguration and riparian replanting may be described as river restoration projects. 3. Restoration in urban streams is both more expensive and more difficult than restoration in less densely populated catchments. High property values and finely subdivided land and dense human infrastructure (e.g. roads, sewer lines) limit the spatial extent of urban river restoration options, while stormwaters and the associated sediment and pollutant loads may limit the potential for restoration projects to reverse degradation. 4. To be effective, urban stream restoration efforts must be integrated within broader catchment management strategies. A key scientific and management challenge is to establish criteria for determining when the design options for urban river restoration are so constrained that a return towards reference or pre-urbanization conditions is not realistic or feasible and when river restoration presents a viable and effective strategy for improving the ecological condition of these degraded ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Adaptations to the cold and to short growing seasons characterize arctic life, but climate in the Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate. Will plant and animal populations of the Arctic be able to cope with these drastic changes in environmental conditions? Here we explore the potential contribution of evolution by natural selection to the current response of populations to climate change. We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.},

Craspedolepta nebulosa and C. subpunctata were studied on their shared host plant Epilobium angustifolium along an altitudinal transect in the Hardangervidda area of southern Norway. 2. The following was investigated: whether (a) the altitudinal distribution and abundance of each psyllid species was determined by summer heat budgets, acting directly on rates of insect development and/or through their host plant and (b) whether parasitism, predation, and interspecific competition played any role in restricting the distribution of the two species. 3. Craspedolepta nebulosa extended to higher elevations than C. subpunctata but within their ranges neither species showed a clear altitudinal trend in abundance per plant. However, the former species grew to a smaller size with increasing elevation. 4. There was little evidence for interspecific competitive effects and observed levels of parasitism and predation were negligible across the transect. 5. Development and distribution of both species mirrored significant differences in the phenology, size, leaf number, and reproductive output of E. angustifolium with increasing altitude. 6. Distributions were related to available heat budgets acting on psyllid/plant development rates, with C. nebulosa developing more efficiently at lower heat availability. 7. Population transplant experiments supported the overall conclusions, with neither psyllid species able to establish viable populations above their current upper altitudinal range limit, despite the presence of their host plant.},

	Abstract = {The effects of urbanization on biodiversity are well established, as a growing city will reduce the size and diversity of patches of native plants. Recolonization of old patches and discovery of new ones by arthropod herbivores should occur as predicted by island biogeography theory. Although colonization represents an increase in biodiversity, such arrivals may exert new forms of natural selection on plants through herbivory and seed predation. Using a single species of old-field aster (Solidago altissima L.), we found that the level of natural selection by seed predators and herbivores follows patterns of island biogeography, with lower amounts of damage on smaller islands, where there are fewer species, and hypothetically smaller populations of arthropods. We also found that in an urban system, levels of herbivory are far below the tolerance levels of Solidago, and that seed predators are likely to be the only arthropod to cause reduced fitness. The pattern seen also implies that as a patch of Solidago grows through clonal expansion, it will come under higher selective pressure.},

	Abstract = {Question: Do realistic models predict that infectious disease will select for altered life histories? Specifically, under what conditions can trophic disease transmission influence life-history evolution in tiger salamanders by selecting against cannibalistic morphs? Data: Previous information from laboratory and field studies on Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum populations from the Kaibab Plateau and Mogollon Rim regions of northern Arizona. Features of model: Differential equation model incorporating ecological, epidemiological, and genetic structure of tiger salamander populations. Conclusions: The model can replicate observed patterns of density, phenotypic and genotypic frequency of cannibal morphs, but only by assuming very high disease levels. Disease-induced mortality of both aquatic and terrestrial adults is necessary to reduce the genotypic frequency of cannibalism to observed levels. Given the high forces of infection required to reduce genetic propensity towards cannibalism, other life-history trade-offs may also constrain the genotypic frequency of cannibalism in tiger salamanders. More generally, cannibalism and infectious disease,may interfere with each other by reducing population densities, limiting disease-induced selection against cannibalism.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists often use nonlinear fitting techniques to estimate the parameters of complex ecological models, with attendant frustration. This paper compares three open-source model fitting tools and discusses general strategies for defining and fitting models. R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn, AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve, while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed. Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https://groups-nceas-ucsb-edu.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/nonlinear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.},

	Abstract = {Although it has been recognized as a key parameter of wood quality and a good source of information on growth, annual wood density has been little studied within diffuse-porous trees such as beech ( Fagus sylvatica Liebl.). In this paper we examine the variability encountered in beech ring density series and analyze the influences of ring age, ring width, climate and between-tree variability on density. Thirty ring sequences were sampled from 55-year- old dominant beech trees growing within the same stand; ring density and width were measured using radiography. Ring density proved to be less variable through time than ring width. The relationship between these two variables was less than observed in ring-porous trees and it showed great variation between trees. The sensitivity of ring width and density to climate was also different; width was strongly linked to soil water deficit whereas density was correlated to temperature and August rainfall. Unlike ring width, wood density showed sensitivity towards climatic characteristics of the late growing season. A large part of annual density variability remains unexplained, even using advanced modelled water balance variables. We hypothesize that a significant part of the tree ring is under internal control. We also demonstrated great inter-tree variability (the tree effect) in ring density, which has an influence on density but not on trees' response to climate.},

Stochastic variation in structured population models influences estimates of population growth rate, persistence and resilience, which ultimately can alter community composition, species interactions, distributions and harvesting. Here, we discuss how understanding these demographic consequences of environmental variation will have applications for anticipating changes in populations resulting from anthropogenic activities that affect the variance in vital rates. We also highlight new tools for anticipating the consequences of the magnitude and temporal patterning of environmental variability.},

	Abstract = {The primary nonbiological result of recent rapid climate change is warming winter temperatures, particularly at northern latitudes, leading to longer growing seasons and new seasonal exigencies and opportunities. Biological responses reflect selection due to the earlier arrival of spring, the later arrival of fall, or the increasing length of the growing season. Animals from rotifers to rodents use the high reliability of day length to time the seasonal transitions in their life histories that are crucial to fitness in temperate and polar environments: when to begin developing in the spring, when to reproduce, when to enter dormancy or when to migrate, thereby exploiting favourable temperatures and avoiding unfavourable temperatures. In documented cases of evolutionary (genetic) response to recent, rapid climate change, the role of day length (photoperiodism) ranges from causal to inhibitory; in no case has there been demonstrated a genetic shift in thermal optima or thermal tolerance. More effort should be made to explore the role of photoperiodism in genetic responses to climate change and to rule out the role of photoperiod in the timing of seasonal life histories before thermal adaptation is assumed to be the major evolutionary response to climate change.},

Over the last 30 years, the genetically controlled photoperiodic response of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, has shifted toward shorter, more southern daylengths as growing seasons have become longer. This shift is detectable over a time interval as short as 5 years. Faster evolutionary response has occurred in northern populations where selection is stronger and genetic variation is greater than in southern populations.

	Abstract = {Plant adaptation to serpentine soil has been a topic of study for many decades, yet investigation of the genetic component of this adaptation has only recently begun. We review the defining properties of serpentine soil and the pioneering work leading to three established physiological and evolutionary mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible for serpentine tolerance: tolerance of a low calcium-to-magnesium ratio, avoidance of Mg toxicity, or a high Mg requirement. In addition, we review recent work in serpentine ecology documenting the high proportion of endemic species present, the adaptive morphologies of serpentine-tolerant plants, and the distinctive structure of serpentine communities. Studies of the physiological mechanisms proposed to confer serpentine tolerance have shown that uptake of particular ions and heavy metals varies between serpentine-tolerant and -intolerant species. Recent studies examining the genetic basis of serpentine adaptation have shown serpentine-adaptive quantitative trait loci (QTL) to have large phenotypic effects, drought tolerance to be as important as metal tolerance, and serpentine adaptation to have evolved independently multiple times within species. Investigations of plant races and species adapted to contrasting soil types have shown disparate flowering times, divergent floral morphologies, and pollen incompatibility to contribute to reproductive isolation. Finally, we propose that future studies involving serpentine systems should merge the fields of ecology, evolution, physiology, and genetics.},

Population trends in these species are inadequately assessed by current monitoring programmes: the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) mainly samples semi-natural habitats; coarse-scale distribution recording under-estimates declines in population abundance. We designed a scheme (the wider countryside butterfly survey-WCBS) to provide unbiased abundance trends for widespread butterfly species across the whole countryside. The WCBS has been developed over a 3 year pilot study, culminating in a UK-wide roll out in 2009. After testing a range of survey methods, the scheme involves visiting randomly selected 1-km squares at least twice during July-August and walking a linear transect route, counting the number of individual butterflies seen within 5 m. A method for volunteer recorders to collect abundance data on non-lepidopteran insects was also tested. The results of the first year of the WCBS and future plans for the scheme will be described.},

	Abstract = {Future drought is projected to occur under warmer temperature conditions as climate change progresses, referred to here as global-change-type drought, yet quantitative assessments of the triggers and potential extent of drought-induced vegetation die-off remain pivotal uncertainties in assessing climate-change impacts. Of particular concern is regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which rapidly alters ecosystem type, associated ecosystem properties, and land surface conditions for decades. Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that after 15 months of depleted soil water content, >90% of the dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a pinon) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 km(2) or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous subcontinental drought of the 1950s. The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species' distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the potential for such die-off to be more severe and extensive for future global-change-type drought under warmer conditions.},

	Abstract = {If habitat destruction or overexploitation of populations is severe, species loss can occur directly and abruptly. Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and metaanalytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species.},

	Abstract = {The need to adapt to climate change has become increasingly apparent, and many believe the practice of biodiversity conservation will need to alter to face this challenge. Conservation organizations are eager to determine how they should adapt their practices to climate change. This involves asking the fundamental question of what adaptation to climate change means. Most studies on climate change and conservation, if they consider adaptation at all, assume it is equivalent to the ability of species to adapt naturally to climate change as stated in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Adaptation, however, can refer to an array of activities that range from natural adaptation, at one end of the spectrum, to sustainability science in coupled human and natural systems at the other. Most conservation organizations deal with complex systems in which adaptation to climate change involves making decisions on priorities for biodiversity conservation in the face of dynamic risks and involving the public in these decisions. Discursive methods such as analytic deliberation are useful for integrating scientific knowledge with public perceptions and values, particularly when large uncertainties and risks are involved. The use of scenarios in conservation planning is a useful way to build shared understanding at the science-policy interface. Similarly, boundary organizations-organizations or institutions that bridge different scales or mediate the relationship between science and policy-could prove useful for managing the transdisciplinary nature of adaptation to climate change, providing communication and brokerage services and helping to build adaptive capacity. The fact that some nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are active across the areas of science, policy, and practice makes them well placed to fulfill this role in integrated assessments of biodiversity conservation and adaptation to climate change.La necesidad de adaptarse al cambio climatico es cada vez mas aparente, y muchos creen que la practica de la conservacion de la biodiversidad tendra que alterarse para enfrentar este reto. Las organizaciones de conservacion tienen interes en determinar como deben adaptar sus practicas al cambio climatico. Esto implica responder la pregunta fundamental de lo que significa adaptacion al cambio climatico. La mayoria de los estudios sobre cambio climatico y conservacion, si acaso consideran la adaptacion, asumen que es equivalente a la habilidad de las especies a adaptarse naturalmente al cambio climatico en los terminos del Articulo 2 de la Convencion del Cambio Climatico de las Naciones Unidas. Sin embargo, adaptacion se puede referir a un conjunto de actividades que varian entre la adaptacion natural en un extremo del espectro, y ciencia de la sustentabilidad en sistemas naturales y humanos en el otro. La mayoria de las organizaciones de conservacion tratan con sistemas complejos en los que la adaptacion al cambio climatico implica la toma de decisiones sobre prioridades para la conservacion de la biodiversidad frente a riesgos dinamicos y el involucramiento del publico en estas decisiones. Los metodos discursivos como la deliberacion analitica son utiles para la integracion de conocimiento cientifico con las percepciones y valores del publico, particularmente cuando implican grandes riesgos e incertidumbres. El uso de escenarios en la planificacion de la conservacion es una forma util para construir el entendimiento de la interfase ciencia-politica. Similarmente, las organizaciones frontera - organizaciones o istituciones que unen escalas diferentes o que median la relacion entre la ciencia y la politica - podrian ser utiles para el manejo de la naturaleza transdisciplinaria de la adaptacion al cambio climatico, para proporcionar servicios de comunicacion y correduria y para ayudar a construir capacidad adaptativa. El hecho de que algunas organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) son activas en las areas de la ciencia, la politica y la practica las posiciona para desempenar este papel en evaluaciones integrales de conservacion de la biodiversidad y adaptacion al cambio climatico.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses two main questions. First, can evergreen foliage that has been structurally determined as sun foliage acclimate physiologically when it is shaded? Second, is this acclimation independent of the foliage ageing process and source-sink relations? To investigate these questions, a shading and debudding experiment was established using paired branches on open-grown Abies amabilis trees. For each tree, one branch was either shaded, debudded, or both, from before budbreak until the end of summer, while the other branch functioned as a control. Foliage samples were measured both prior to and during treatment for photosynthesis at light saturation (A(max)), dark respiration, nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll-to-nitrogen ratio and chlorophyll a:b ratio. All age classes of foliage responded similarly during the treatment, although pre-treatment values differed between age classes. Within 1 month after the treatment began, A(max) was lower in shaded foliage and remained lower throughout the treatment period. For debudded branches, A(max) was lower than the controls only during active shoot elongation, At the end of the treatments in September, A(max) in shade-treated sun foliage matched the rates in the true shade-formed foliage, but nitrogen remained significantly higher. By 1.5 months after treatment, chlorophyll content in shaded foliage was higher than in controls, and the chlorophyll a:b ratio was lower for the shaded foliage. On debudded branches, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a:b ratio were similar to the values in control samples. Shading lowered the rate of nitrogen accumulation within a branch, while removing debudding decreased the amount of sequestered N that was exported from the older foliage to supply new growth. By September, chlorophyll content in shade-treated foliage was higher than that in the control sun foliage or in true shade foliage. The chlorophyll increase as a result of shading was unexpected. However, the chlorophyll-to-nitrogen ratio was identical for the shade-treated sun foliage and the true shade foliage while being significantly lower than the control sun foliage. It appears that acclimation to shading in mature foliage involves a reallocation of nitrogen within the leaf into thylakoid proteins. A redistribution of resources (nitrogen) among leaves is secondary and appears to function on a slower time scale than reallocation within the leaf. Thus, A. amabilis foliage that is structurally determined as sun foliage can acclimate to shade within a few months; this process is most likely independent of ageing and is only slightly affected by source-sink relations within a branch.},

	Abstract = {Variation in the photosynthetic function of Abies amabilis foliage within a canopy was examined and related to three different precesses that affect foliage function: foliage aging, sun-shade acclimation that occurred while foliage was expanding, and reacclimation after expansion was complete. Foliage produced in the sun had higher photosynthesis at light saturation (A(max), mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)), dark respiration (mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)), nitrogen content (g . m(-2)), chlorophyll content (g . m(-2)), and chlorophyll a:b ratio, and a lower chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio (chl:N), than foliage produced in the shade. As sun foliage becomes shaded, it becomes physiologically similar to shade foliage, even though it still retains a sun morphology. Shaded sun foliage exhibited lower A(max), dark respiration, nitrogen content, and chlorophyll a:b ratio, and a higher chl:N ratio than sun foliage of the same age remaining in the open. However, shaded sun foliage had a higher chlorophyll content than sun foliage remaining in the open, even though true shade foliage had a lower chlorophyll content than sun foliage. This anomaly arises because as sun foliage becomes shaded, it retains a higher nitrogen content than shade foliage in a similar light environment, but the two forms have similar chl:N ratios. Within the canopy, most physiological indicators were more strongly correlated with the current light environment than with foliage age or leaf thickness, with the exception of chlorophyll content. A(max) decreased significantly with both decreasing current light environment of the foliage and increasing foliage age. The same trend with current light and age was found for the chlorophyll a:b ratio. Foliage nitrogen content also decreased with a decrease in current light environment, but no distinct pattern was found with foliage age. Leaf thickness was also important for predicting leaf nitrogen content: thicker leaves had more nitrogen than thinner leaves regardless of light environment or age. The chl:N ratio had a strong negative correlation with the current light environment, and, as with nitrogen content, no distinct pattern was found with foliage age. Chlorophyll content of the foliage was not well correlated with any of the three predictor variables: current light environment, foliage age or leaf thickness. On the other hand, chlorophyll content was positively correlated with the amount of nitrogen in a leaf, and once nitrogen was considered, the current Light environment was also highly significant in explaining the variation in chlorophyll content. It has been suggested that the redistribution of nitrogen both within and between leaves is a mechanism for photosynthetic acclimation to the current light environment. Within these A. amabilis canopies, both leaf nitrogen and the chl:N ratio were strongly correlated with the current light environment, but only weakly with leaf age, supporting the idea that changing light is the driving force for the redistribution of nitrogen both within and between leaves. Thus, our results support previous theories on nitrogen distribution and partitioning. However, A(max) was significantly affected by both foliage age and the current light environment, indicating that changes in light alone are not enough to explain changes in A(max) with time.},

We hope this synthesis improves understanding of these prioritization approaches and that it results in more efficient allocation of geographically flexible conservation funding.},

No statistically significant change in participants' attitudes toward science or the environment, or in participants' understanding of the scientific process, could be detected.

Within the old-growth stand, both daytime canopy [CO2] and canopy delta(13)C stayed close to those of the troposphere, either indicating low overall photosynthetic rates or high turbulent mixing. Pronounced periods of photosynthetic drawdown below baseline [CO2] accompanied by more enriched canopy delta(13)C were observed for the two younger and denser stands. Canopy [CO2] profiles seemed closely related to changes in soil conditions. Soil respiration rates were positively related to soil temperature, but negatively to soil moisture. delta(13)C of soil-respired CO2 stayed relatively constant at -24.55 +/- 0.20 parts per thousand during the growing season. Significant relationships existed between canopy delta(13)C and 1/[CO2] in all three stands. Using the intercepts of these regressions, we calculated an average delta(13)C for ecosystem respiration of -26.4 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand. Ecosystem carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(e)), an integrating measure for carbon exchange between the troposphere and the entire: ecosystem, stayed relatively constant through time, a, showed no significant stand structure effect (leaf area index, density) and averaged 18.9 parts per thousand for the old-growth and 19.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand for the two younger stands.},

This is of particular interest for mid-latitudinal environments where future rates of climate change are expected to be most rapid. Here we present a network of 28 TRW and 21 MXD chronologies from living and relict conifers. Data cover an area from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Mediterranean Sea in the east and an altitudinal gradient from 1,000 to 2,500 m asl. Age trends, spatial autocorrelation functions, carry-over effects, variance changes, and climate responses were analyzed for the individual sites and two parameter-specific regional means. Variations in warm season (May-September) temperature mainly control MXD formation (r = 0.58 to 0.87 from inter-annual to decadal time-scales), whereas lower TRW sensitivity to temperature remains unstable over space and time.},

Recent advances in fisheries science could revolutionize management of harvested stocks by evaluating management scenarios in a virtual world by including stakeholders and by assessing its robustness to uncertainty. These advances have been synthesized into a framework, management strategy evaluation (WISE), which has hitherto not been used in terrestrial conservation. We review the potential of MSE to transform terrestrial conservation, emphasizing that the behavior of individual harvesters must be included because harvester compliance with management rules has been a major challenge in conservation. Incorporating resource user decision-making required to make MSEs relevant to terrestrial conservation will also advance fisheries science.},

	Abstract = {This study reviewed the distribution of ten common savanna trees in Namibia. Tree distributions were investigated in relation to bioclimatic, topographic and edaphic variables at a national scale. The factors of importance at these broad geographic scales appeared to be rainfall, substrate and, likely, the incidence of frost. Baikiaea plurijuga, Burkea africana, Guibourtia coleosperma and Pterocarpus angolensis seem to reach their bioclimatic limits in Namibia. At the local level, plant traits become important and contribute to explaining distribution patterns. High water and/or nitrogen use efficiency (Acacia erioloba, Colophospermum mopane), dual water obtaining strategies (Faidherbia albida), fire tolerance (e.g. Acacia species, Burkea ajicana and Pterocarpus angolensis) and drought tolerance (Boscia albitrunca) are some key attributes providing additional explanations for current distributions. Amongst the selected trees and at broad geographic scales, below-ground adaptations are governed by rainfall regime in combination with coarse-textured soils, whereby shallow-rooted trees prevail in the Kalahari sandveld. Deep-rooted species are found largely on non-sandy soils. Physiological performance of many trees appears to be directly linked to rainfall regime and trees may hence show varying performance throughout their distribution range. Insight into plant functional attributes of trees in Namibia is required to develop appropriate management strategies in the light of climate change. Modelling climate change impacts should consider the relative contribution of bioclimatic versus local environmental factors that explain the current distribution patterns of the selected trees.

These ecological phenomena normally vary within bounded ranges, but rapid, nonlinear changes to markedly different conditions can be triggered by even small differences if threshold values arc exceeded. Intrinsic and extrinsic ecological thresholds can lead to effects that cascade among systems, precluding accurate modeling and prediction of system response to climate change. Ten case studies from North America illustrate how charges in climate can lead to rapid, threshold-type responses within ecological communities;, the case studies also highlight the role of human activities that alter the rate or direction of system response to climate change. Understanding and anticipating nonlinear dynamics are important aspects of adaptation planning since responses of biological resources to changes in the physical climate system are not necessarily proportional and sometimes, as in the case of complex ecological systems, inherently nonlinear.

	Abstract = {Differential phenological responses to climate among species are predicted to disrupt trophic interactions, but datasets to evaluate this are scarce. We compared phenological trends for species from 4 levels of a North Sea food web over 24 yr when sea surface temperature (SST) increased significantly. We found little consistency in phenological trends between adjacent trophic levels, no significant relationships with SST, and no significant pairwise correlations between predator and prey phenologies, suggesting that trophic mismatching is occurring. Finer resolution data on timing of peak energy demand (mid-chick-rearing) for 5 seabird species at a major North Sea colony were compared to modelled daily changes in length of 0-group (young of the year) lesser sandeels Ammodytes marinus. The date at which sandeels reached a given threshold length became significantly later during the study. Although the phenology of all the species except shags also became later, these changes were insufficient to keep pace with sandeel length, and thus mean length (and energy value) of 0-group sandeels at mid-chick-rearing showed net declines. The magnitude of declines in energy value varied among the seabirds, being more marked in species showing no phenological response (shag, 4.80 kJ) and in later breeding species feeding on larger sandeels (kittiwake, 2.46 kJ) where, due to the relationship between sandeel length and energy value being non-linear, small reductions in length result in relatively large reductions in energy. However, despite the decline in energy value of 0-group sandeels during chick-rearing, there was no evidence of any adverse effect on breeding success for any of the seabird species. Trophic mismatch appears to be prevalent within the North Sea pelagic food web, suggesting that ecosystem functioning may be disrupted.},

	Abstract = {Inbreeding depression critically influences both mating system evolution and the persistence of small populations prone to accumulate mutations. Under some circumstances, however, inbreeding will tend to purge populations of enough deleterious recessive mutations to reduce inbreeding depression (ID). The extent of purging depends on many population and genetic factors, making it impossible to make universal predictions. We review 52 studies that compare levels of ID among species, populations, and lineages inferred to differ in inbreeding history. Fourteen of 34 studies comparing ID among populations and species found significant evidence for purging. Within populations, many studies report among-family variation in ID, and 6 of 18 studies found evidence for purging among lineages. Regression analyses suggest that purging is most likely to ameliorate ID for early traits (6 studies), but these declines are typically modest (5-10%). Meta-analyses of results from 45 populations in 11 studies reveal no significant overall evidence for purging, but rather the opposite tendency, for more selfing populations to experience higher ID for early traits. The likelihood of finding purging does not vary systematically with experimental design or whether early or late traits are considered. Perennials are somewhat less likely to show purging than annuals (2 of 10 vs. 7 of 14). We conclude that although these results doubtless reflect variation in population and genetic parameters, they also suggest that purging is an inconsistent force within populations. Such results also imply that attempts to deliberately reduce the load via inbreeding in captive rearing programs may be misguided. Future studies should examine male and female fitness traits over the entire life cycle, estimate mating histories at all levels (i.e. population and families within populations), report data necessary for meta-analysis, and statistically test for purging of genetic loads.},

	Abstract = {One procedure for guiding seed transfer is to partition the species habitat into zones within which there is little genetic variation from location to location. This report compares soil types and the existing regional seed zones as bases for classifying geographic genetic variation into zones. The data used were genotypic values of 135 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) trees from 80 locations in a 15,000 km2 area in southwestern Oregon. Genotypic values were estimated by measuring traits expressing phenology and growth potential of 2-year seedlings in a common-garden experiment. Neither the soils model nor the seed-zones model satisfactorily classified geographic genetic variation (significant lack of fit). When physiographic variables (latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) were added to the models, the added variables accounted for 16% to 23% of the total variation among locations. Gradients of genetic variation therefore exist within soil types and present seed zones. These gradients reflect the overall gradients of geographic variation with latitude, longitude, and elevation that occur in the region. The results suggest that zones constructed from a physiographic model may explain more of the genetic variation in southwestern Oregon than do either soils or seed-zones models.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variances, heritabilities, and genetic correlations of floral traits were measured in the monocarpic perennial Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae). A paternal half-sib design was employed to generate seeds in each of four years, and seeds were planted back in the field near the parental site. The progeny were followed for up to eight years to estimate quantitative genetic parameters subject to natural levels of environmental variation over the entire life cycle. Narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.2-0.8 were detected for the morphometric traits of corolla length, corolla width, stigma position, and anther position. The proportion of time spent by the protandrous flowers in the pistillate phase (''proportion pistillate'') also exhibited detectable heritability of near 0.3. In contrast, heritability estimates for nectar reward traits were low and not significantly different from zero, due to high environmental variance between and within flowering years. The estimates of genetic parameters were combined with phenotypic selection gradients to predict evolutionary responses to selection mediated by the hummingbird pollinators. One trait, corolla width, showed the potential for a rapid response to ongoing selection through male function, as it experienced both direct selection, by influencing pollen export, and relatively high heritability. Predicted responses were lower for proportion pistillate and corolla length, even though these traits also experienced direct selection. Stigma position was expected to respond positively to indirect selection of proportion pistillate but negatively to selection of corolla length, with the net effect sensitive to variation in the selection estimates. Anther position also was not directly selected but could respond to indirect selection of genetically correlated traits.},

	Abstract = {Recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species often must be initiated with incomplete data. The outcomes of such efforts are difficult to predict, which makes monitoring the progress of recovery efforts an integral part of the recovery process. We evaluated the role of monitoring in recovery plans for 181 species listed as threatened and endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We considered both the extent to which monitoring tasks were proposed as part of the recovery effort and the extent to which the tasks proposed were actually implemented. In general, tasks devoted to tracking the species' population trend were more likely to be proposed and implemented than were other monitoring activities (e.g., those devoted to the species' demographic, its habitat requirements, or the impact of predators, competitors, and exotics). We found that the extent and nature of the monitoring proposed and implemented appeared to reflect taxonomic biases that exist throughout the recovery process and were little influenced either by the level of understanding of the species' biology or by the recovery priority assigned to the species. In particular, monitoring efforts did not adequately address the specific threats affecting species. Proposals for, and implementation of, monitoring progress toward recovery goals were independent of the type of criteria defined in the plans (e.g., population level and habitat extent), although population-related criteria were disproportionately common. Based on these findings, we caution against an overemphasis on focal species monitoring, especially when such an emphasis leads to the reduction or exclusion of other types of monitoring. We also recommend that species-specific attributes factor more prominently in the development of monitoring to avoid monitoring action that is otherwise unnecessary.},

	Abstract = {The vegetation in a high alpine site of the European Alps experienced changes in area between 1953 and 2003 as a result of climate change. Shrubs showed rapid expansion rates of 5.6% per decade at altitudes between 2400 m and 2500 m. Above 2500 m, vegetation coverage exhibited unexpected patterns of regression associated with increased precipitation and permafrost degradation. As these changes follow a sharp increase in both summer and annual temperatures after 1980, we suggest that vegetation of the alpine (2400-2800 m) and nival (above 2800 m) belts respond in a fast and flexible way, contradicting previous hypotheses that alpine and nival species appear to have a natural inertia and are able to tolerate an increase of 1-2 degrees C in mean air temperature.},

	Abstract = {In the European Alps the increase in air temperature was more than twice the increase in global mean temperature over the last 50 years. The abiotic ( glacial) and the biotic components ( plants and vegetation) of the mountain environment are showing ample evidence of climate change impacts. In the Alps most small glaciers (80% of total glacial coverage and an important contribution to water resources) could disappear in the next decades. Recently climate change was demonstrated to affect higher levels of ecological systems, with vegetation exhibiting surface area changes, indicating that alpine and nival vegetation may be able to respond in a fast and flexible way in response to 1-2 degrees C warming. We analyzed the glacier evolution ( terminus fluctuations, mass balances, surface area variations), local climate, and vegetation succession on the forefield of Sforzellina Glacier ( Upper Valtellina, central Italian Alps) over the past three decades. We aimed to quantify the impacts of climate change on coupled biotic and abiotic components of high alpine ecosystems, to verify if an acceleration was occurring on them during the last decade (i.e., 1996-2006) and to assess whether new specific strategies were adopted for plant colonization and development. All the glaciological data indicate that a glacial retreat and shrinkage occurred and was much stronger after 2002 than during the last 35 years. Vegetation started to colonize surfaces deglaciated for only one year, with a rate at least four times greater than that reported in the literature for the establishment of scattered individuals and about two times greater for the well-established discontinuous early-successional community. The colonization strategy changed: the first colonizers are early-successional, scree slopes, and perennial clonal species with high phenotypic plasticity rather than pioneer and snowbed species. This impressive acceleration coincided with only slight local summer warming ( approximately +0.5 degrees C) and a poorly documented local decrease in the snow cover depth and duration. Are we facing accelerated ecological responses to climatic changes and/or did we go beyond a threshold over which major ecosystem changes may occur in response to even minor climatic variations?.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as 'Green Peas', first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O iii] lambda 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to similar to 1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some active galactic nuclei interlopers including eight newly discovered narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low-mass galaxies (M similar to 108.5-1010 M(circle dot)) with high star formation rates (similar to 10 M(circle dot) yr-1), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 similar to 8.7) and low reddening [E(B - V) < 0.25] and they reside in low-density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to similar to 10-8 yr-1) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myr. The few star-forming Peas with Hubble Space Telescope imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. They are also similar to high-redshift ultraviolet-luminous galaxies, e.g. Lyman-break galaxies and Ly alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

	Abstract = {Predictions for the evolution of mating systems and genetic load vary, depending on the genetic basis of inbreeding depression (dominance versus overdominance, epistasis and the relative frequencies of genes of large and small effect). A distinction between the dominance and overdominance hypotheses is that deleterious recessive mutations should be purged in inbreeding populations. Comparative studies of populations differing in their level of inbreeding and experimental approaches that allow selection among inbred lines support this prediction. More direct biometric approaches provide strong support for the importance of partly recessive deleterious alleles. Investigators using molecular markers to study quantitative trait loci (QTL) often find support for overdominance, though pseudo-overdominance (deleterious alleles linked in repulsion) may bias this perception. QTL and biometric studies of inbred lines often find evidence for epistasis, which may also contribute to the perception of overdominance, though this may be because of the divergent lines initially crossed in QTL studies. Studies of marker segregation distortion commonly uncover genes of major effect on viability, but these have only minor contributions to inbreeding depression. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of inbreeding depression, we feel that all three aspects merit more study in natural plant populations.},

Cross-pollinations were performed both within and between populations in order to examine the scale at which the genetic load is distributed. We found significant inbreeding depression in M. guttatus in four of the six traits, with the highest inbreeding depression observed in biomass (68% and 69% based on within- and between-population crosses, respectively) and lowest in ovule production (21% based on between-population crosses only). M. micranthus displayed significant inbreeding depression in only two of the six traits examined. Again, we observed the highest inbreeding depression in biomass (47-60% based on within- and between-population crosses, respectively), but both traits showing significant differences between self and outcross progeny expressed lower inbreeding depression than in M. guttatus. We detected no significant inbreeding depression for either pollen or ovule production in M. micranthus. An estimate of total inbreeding depression based on the multiplicative effects of all traits was also lower in M. micanthus than in M. guttatus. Our results are consistent with the expected purging of generic load in populations with high selfing rates. The absence of inbreeding depression in M. micranthus pollen and ovule production, two traits with strong links to fitness in a selfing annual, further suggests the important role of directional selection in determining the population's genetic load. Comparison of cross-pollinations made within and between populations revealed little evidence of divergence of genetic load among the M. micranthus and M. guttatus populations examined.},

	Abstract = {The effects of one generation of selfing and outcrossing on six life history characters were examined in the greenhouse for two populations of the mixed-mating species Mimulus guttatus. Inbreeding depression was not detected in the mass of seed produced by maternal plants, but selfing significantly reduced germination success by 13-20 per cent relative to outcross seeds. Seedlings produced by self-pollination were 26-31 per cent smaller than outcross progeny. Late life history stages were examined under varied competitive regimes in which each plant was grown with a neighbour of either an inbred or outbred individual. Progeny resulting from self-pollinations showed a 14-30 per cent reduction in ovule number per locule, and their pollen production per flower was reduced by 28-33 per cent. Adult above-ground biomass showed the greatest inbreeding depression, ranging from 24-50 per cent depending on the competitive conditions. Thus progeny resulting from selfing are smaller as adults and contribute significantly fewer potential gametes into the gene pool as pollen grains and ovules. The multiplicative effects of these characters is calculated. For all traits except ovule number, outcross progeny from parents of the same population did not differ significantly from outcross progeny produced by parents that came from populations separated by 10 km, suggesting relatively little differentiation between populations. The relative performance of self and outcross progeny in later life history stages was independent of the relative performance observed in earlier stages.},

We examined the effects of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen using the mixed-mating Mimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Inbred (self) and outbred M. guttatus from two California populations (M5 and M13) were rub-inoculated with CMV and compared to sham-inoculated controls. Flower production by outbred plants in host population M5 showed little effect of the inoculation treatment, but inoculation reduced flower production of inbred plants by 12%, indicating that inbreeding reduces tolerance to CMV infection. This interaction fell short of significance, however. The effects of inbreeding and CMV inoculation on biomass in M5 varied significantly across the 15 families used in this experiment, indicating genetic variation in the effect of inbreeding on resistance or tolerance to CMV. CMV infection reduced biomass in host population M13, but there were no significant interactions between virus treatment and level of inbreeding for either flower production or biomass. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect CMV in host tissues. In both populations, mean ELISA absorbance values of inoculated plants were nearly identical for self and outcross hosts, indicating equal susceptibility to CMV. In outbred plants of population M5, flower production did not change with increasing ELISA absorbance, but in inbred plants it declined, indicating reduced tolerance to CMV infection. The results from this study suggest that pathogens may become increasingly detrimental as host populations become more inbred.},

	Abstract = {Over the next century, ecosystems throughout the world will be responding to rapid changes in climate and rising levels of carbon dioxide, inorganic N and ozone. Because people depend on biological systems for water, food and other ecosystem services, predicting the range of responses to global change for various ecosystem types in different geographic locations is a high priority. Modeling exercises and manipulative experimentation have been the principle approaches used to place upper and lower bounds on community and ecosystem responses. However, each of these approaches has recognized limitations. Manipulative experiments cannot vary all the relevant factors and are often performed at small spatio-temporal scales. Modeling is limited by data availability and by our knowledge of how current observations translate into future conditions. These weaknesses would improve if we could observe ecosystems that have already responded to global change factors and thus presage shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Here we consider whether urban forest remnants might offer this ability. As urban forests have been exposed to elevated temperature, carbon dioxide, nitrogen deposition and ozone for many decades, they may be ahead of the global change "response curve" for forests in their region. Therefore, not only might forests along urbanization gradients provide us with natural experiments for studying current responses to global change factors, but their legacy of response to past urbanization may also constitute space-for-time substitution experiments for predicting likely regional forest responses to continued environmental change. For this approach to be successful, appropriate criteria must be developed for selecting forest remnants and plots that would optimize our ability to detect incipient forest responses to spatial variation in global change factors along urbanization gradients, while minimizing artifacts associated with remnant size and factors other than those that simulate global change. Studying forests that meet such criteria along urban-to-rural gradients could become an informative part of a mixed strategy of approaches for improving forecasts of forest ecosystem change at the regional scale.},

	Abstract = {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene now. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does nor necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

	Abstract = {Diurnal and seasonal tree water storage was studied in three large Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) trees at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research site. Changes in water storage were based on measurements of sap flow and changes in stem volume and tissue water content at different heights in the stem and branches. We measured sap flow by two variants of the heat balance method (with internal heating in stems and external heating in branches), stem volume with electronic dendrometers, and tissue water content gravimetrically. Water storage was calculated from the differences in diurnal courses of sap flow at different heights and their integration. Old-growth Douglas-fir trees contained large amounts of free water: stem sapwood was the most important storage site, followed by stem phloem, branch sapwood, branch phloem and needles. There were significant time shifts (minutes to hours) between sap flow measured at different positions within the transport system (i.e., stem base to shoot tip), suggesting a highly elastic transport system. On selected fine days between late July and early October, when daily transpiration ranged from 150 to 300 liters, the quantity of stored water used daily ranged from 25 to 55 liters, i.e., about 20% of daily total sap flow. The greatest amount of this stored water came from the lower stem; however, proportionally more water was removed from the upper parts of the tree relative to their water storage capacity. In addition to lags in sap flow from one point in the hydrolic pathway to another, the withdrawal and replacement of stored water was reflected in changes in stem volume. When point-to-point lags in sap flow (minutes to hours near the top and stem base, respectively) were considered, there was a strong linear relationship between stem volume changes and transpiration. Volume changes of the whole tree were small (equivalent to 14% of the total daily use of stored water) indicating that most stored water came from the stem and from its inelastic (sapwood) tissues. Whole tree transpiration can be maintained with stored water for about a week, but it can be maintained with stored water from the upper crown alone for no more than a few hours.},

This paper studied the differing responses to climate warming shown by desert plants of different ecotypes through analyzing the phenology and meteorological data of 22 desert plant species growing in Minqin Desert Botanical Garden in Northwest China during the period 1974-2009. The results indicate: (1) The temperature in the study area has risen quickly since 1974, and plants' growing periods became longer. The spring phenology of mesophytes advanced, and the autumn phenology of xerophytes was delayed; (2) The starting dates of spring phenophase of mesophytes and xerophytes differed significantly and both showed an advancing trend; (3) The spring phenology of mesophytes advanced by more days than that of xerophytes, whereas the autumn phenology of mesophytes was delayed by less days than that of the xerophytes; and (4) Mesophytes are more sensitive than xerophytes to rising temperature in spring and falling temperature in autumn. These findings are of value in plant management and regional introduction of different species.},

However, phenotypic plasticity provides the potential for organisms to respond rapidly and effectively to environmental change. Using a 47- year population study of the great tit ( Parus major) in the United Kingdom, we show that individual adjustment of behavior in response to the environment has enabled the population to track a rapidly changing environment very closely. Individuals were markedly invariant in their response to environmental variation, suggesting that the current response may be fixed in this population. Phenotypic plasticity can thus play a central role in tracking environmental change; understanding the limits of plasticity is an important goal for future research.},

	Abstract = {Physiological research suggests that tropical insects are particularly sensitive to temperature, but information on their responses to climate change has been lacking - even though the majority of all terrestrial species are insects and their diversity is concentrated in the tropics. Here, we provide evidence that tropical insect species have already undertaken altitude increases, confirming the global reach of climate change impacts on biodiversity. In 2007, we repeated a historical altitudinal transect, originally carried out in 1965 on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, sampling 6 moth assemblages between 1,885 and 3,675 m elevation. We estimate that the average altitudes of individuals of 102 montane moth species, in the family Geometridae, increased by a mean of 67 m over the 42 years. Our findings indicate that tropical species are likely to be as sensitive as temperate species to climate warming, and we urge ecologists to seek other historic tropical samples to carry out similar repeat surveys. These observed changes, in combination with the high diversity and thermal sensitivity of insects, suggest that large numbers of tropical insect species could be affected by climate warming. As the highest mountain in one of the most biodiverse regions of the world, Mount Kinabalu is a globally important refuge for terrestrial species that become restricted to high altitudes by climate warming.},

	Abstract = {Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted during the past decade on species ranges and their relationship to the environment, our understanding of how environmental conditions shape species distribution is still far from complete. Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

	Abstract = {Recent literature on plant population spread advocates quantification of long-distance dispersal (LDD). These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic. In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion. Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals. Stochastic simulations of plant migration overestimate migration of trees, because they typically assume values of R-0 that are too large.},

	Abstract = {Dispersal affects community dynamics and vegetation response to global change. Understanding these effects requires descriptions of dispersal at local and regional scales and statistical models that permit estimation. Classical models of dispersal describe local or long-distance dispersal, but not both. The lack of statistical methods means that models have rarely been fitted to seed dispersal in closed forests. We present a mixture model of dispersal that assumes a range of disperal patterns, both local and long distance. The bivariate Student's t or "2Dt" follows from an assumption that the distance parameter in a Gaussian model varies randomly, thus having a density of its own. We use an inverse approach to "compete" our mixture model against classical alternatives, using seed rain databases from temperate broadleaf, temperate mixed-conifer, and tropical floodplain forests. For most species, the 2Dt model fits dispersal data better than do classical models, The superior fit results from the potential for a convex shape near the source tree and a "fat tail." Our parameter estimates have implications for community dynamics at local scales, for vegetation responses to global change at regional scales, and for differences in seed dispersal among biomes. The 2Dt model predicts that less seed travels beyond the immediate crown influence (30 m). Although Gaussian and exponential models predict slow population spread in the face of environmental change, our dispersal estimates suggest rapid spread. The preponderance of animal-dispersed and rare seed types in tropical forests results in noisier patterns of dispersal than occur in temperate hardwood and conifer stands.},

	Abstract = {To promote more effective recovery planning for species listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Society for Conservation Biology sponsored a systematic review of a large sample of ESA recovery plans. The review was conducted in collaboration with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, and 19 universities. We describe the genesis of the project and the development of the resulting database of information on ESA recovery plans. The project's primary goals were to characterize the content and attributes of recovery plans; to identify important differences, patterns, and trends among plans; and to use these results to develop recommendations for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service for improving recovery plans. We review key findings from published analyses of the project database and offer prioritized recommendations for improving recovery-plan development and implementation. First, the use of science in recovery-plan development and implementation could be improved by making threats a primary focus of plans, specifying adequate monitoring tasks for species status and recovery tasks, and ensuring that species trend data are current, quantitative, and documented. Second, recovery-plan structure and development could be enhanced by keeping authorship teams small yet diverse, making existing administrative designations more biologically relevant, improving and standardizing the revision process, and reevaluating the use of multispecies plans. Third, agency resources and personnel could be better utilized by developing new recovery plan guidelines, assigning personnel explicit responsibility for overseeing plan implementation, expanding personnel training, and tracking expenditures in recovery programs. And fourth, several generic failings in the field of conservation biology could be addressed by reducing taxonomic bias and by collecting and fully integrating key biological information into recovery plans. The recovery-plan project offers a model of how professional societies, universities, and government agencies can work together beneficially to address key issues in conservation biology.},

	Abstract = {Advances in computational statistics provide a general framework for the high-dimensional models typically needed for ecological inference and prediction. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) represents a modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent variables and parameters that describe complex relationships. Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all 'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

	Abstract = {Shifting plant phenology (i.e., timing of flowering and other developmental events) in recent decades establishes that species and ecosystems are already responding to global environmental change. Earlier flowering and an extended period of active plant growth across much of the northern hemisphere have been interpreted as responses to warming. However, several kinds of environmental change have the potential to influence the phenology of flowering and primary production. Here, we report shifts in phenology of flowering and canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in response to four experimentally simulated global changes: warming, elevated CO(2), nitrogen (N) deposition, and increased precipitation. Consistent with previous observations, warming accelerated both flowering and greening of the canopy, but phenological responses to the other global change treatments were diverse. Elevated CO(2) and N addition delayed flowering in grasses, but slightly accelerated flowering in forbs. The opposing responses of these two important functional groups decreased their phenological complementarity and potentially increased competition for limiting soil resources. At the ecosystem level, timing of canopy greenness mirrored the flowering phenology of the grasses, which dominate primary production in this system. Elevated CO(2) delayed greening, whereas N addition dampened the acceleration of greening caused by warming. Increased precipitation had no consistent impacts on phenology. This diversity of phenological changes, between plant functional groups and in response to multiple environmental changes, helps explain the diversity in large-scale observations and indicates that changing temperature is only one of several factors reshaping the seasonality of ecosystem processes.},

	Abstract = {Ring-width chronologies have been developed for alpine larch (Larix lyallii Parl.) at six tree-line sites in the Banff-Kananaskis area of the southern Canadian Rockies. Evaluation of all chronologies confirms that alpine larch ring-width series have higher mean sensitivities, lower autocorrelation, and greater common variance than series from other tree species growing at tree line in this area. Missing and very narrow rings created cross-dating difficulties at all sites but were most problematic for the sites along the Continental Divide. Up to 1% of the rings were missing from entire chronologies, but for specific years, up to 77% of the rings were missing at one site. Marker (narrow) rings were present at all sites for the years 1610, 1654, 1715, 1720, 1723, 1752, 1799, 1824, 1842, 1844, 1915, 1925, 1951, and 1971. Tree growth rates were reduced for the periods 1675-1710, 1815-1850, and 1960-1978 whereas increased growth occurred during 1650-1680, 1750-1800, 1850-1900, and 1920-1950. The only factor that could affect all sites over such a broad geographic area is climate. Principal components analysis indicated that the first eigenvector derived from the six chronologies accounted for 70.7% of their common variance and the first three components accounted for 91.6%. The high correlation between the six first principal component and standard chronologies suggested that either method may be used for standardizing tree-ring data from alpine larch.},

Based on new data for plants and insects on an elevational transect in Costa Rica, we assess the potential for lowland biotic attrition, range-shift gaps, and mountaintop extinctions under projected warming. We conclude that tropical lowland biotas may face a level of net lowland biotic attrition without parallel at higher latitudes (where range shifts may be compensated for by species from lower latitudes) and that a high proportion of tropical species soon faces gaps between current and projected elevational ranges.},

Two major gaps were identified: (1) a need to compare and contrast the success (and the situations that induce success) of CBM programs which present sound evidence of citizen scientists influencing positive environmental changes in the local ecosystems they monitor and (2) more case studies showing use of CBM data by decision-makers or the barriers to linkages and how these might be overcome.

	Abstract = {Aquatic insects are the dominant taxon group in most freshwater ecosystems. As temperature is the main driver of their life cycle development, metabolic activity, and geographic distribution, these macroinvertebrates are particularly suitable for large scale and comparative studies of freshwater community responses to climate change. A dataset of bio-ecological traits of 1,942 Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa was used to analyze (1) the relationships among traits, (2) the potential vulnerability of EPT species to climate change, and (3) the geographical occurrence patterns of these potentially endangered species at the scale of European ecoregions. By means of a fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA), two gradients emerged: (1) a longitudinal gradient, describing successive upstream-downstream features, and (2) a biogeographical gradient, separating endemic and micro-endemic species from widely distributed taxa. Moreover, aquatic insects of southern European ecoregions emerged as those most endangered in terms of potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparative multi-taxon studies provide important new insights into freshwater ecosystem functioning and responses to climate change, and could be the first step toward developing integrative monitoring or assessment tools (e.g., trait-based indicators at the species level) by means of non-arbitrary statistical methods.},

	Abstract = {Light is widely considered to be the most important factor limiting the performance of plants on the floors of forests and woodlands, but the roles of nutrient availability and water supply remain poorly defined. We seek to predict the types of forest in which root competition affects seedling performance, and the types of plants that respond most strongly to release from root competition. We then test our predictions by reviewing experiments in which tree seedlings and forest herbs are released from belowground competition, usually by cutting trenches to sever the roots of surrounding trees. First, we provide a worldwide review of changes in canopy form and fine-root mass along gradients of soil fertility and seasonal drought, keeping in mind the stages of forest development. Our review shows that penetration of light is least in forests on moist soils providing large amounts of major nutrients. The changes are far more complex than those considered by allocation models. Dry woodlands typically allow 20 times as much light to penetrate as do wet forests, but there is surprisingly little evidence that they have greater fine-root densities in the topsoil. Tropical rain forests on highly infertile soils have only slightly more open canopies than those on fertile soils, but much greater fine-root densities. Northern temperate forests on highly acidic peats and sandy soils are often dominated by early-successional, open-canopied conifers (generally pines), mostly as a result of recurrent fires, and transmit about five times as much light as surrounding deciduous forests. A review of trenching experiments shows that light alone limits seedling growth in forests on moist, nutrient-rich soils, but competition for belowground resources becomes important on infertile soils and in drier regions. Secondly, we consider how root competition alters species' shade tolerances. Shade-house experiments demonstrate that species differ markedly in the minimum irradiance at which they respond to nutrient addition, but there generally tends to be a sizable response at >5% daylight and little response in <2% daylight. There is some evidence that species that have high potential growth rates and that respond markedly to increased irradiance are also most responsive to nutrient addition in 2-3% daylight. T Smith and M. Huston have hypothesized that species cannot tolerate both shade and drought; this appears to be the case for species that tolerate shade chiefly by maximizing leaf area. However, many shade-tolerant woody plants in tropical and mediterranean-climate forests have thick, tough, long-lived leaves and a relatively high allocation to roots, and these species are much more drought tolerant. A few studies indicate that root trenching allows species to persist in deeper shade than that in which they are normally found and allows species from mesic sites to invade more xeric sites. Usually, the impact of trenching on growth rate is much greater in gaps than in the understory. Finally, we discuss the ways in which life-form composition and population structure of plant communities are shaped by reduced water: supply and reduced nutrient availability, emphasizing the inadequacy of models that consider the impact of "belowground resource availability" in a generic sense. Competition in a dry climate leads to widely spaced dominants, a lack of interstitial plants, high rates of seedling mortality in the understory, and a restriction of regeneration to patches where established matrix-forming plants have died. In contrast, vegetation on moist, infertile sites is characterized by closely packed, slender dominants, miniaturized interstitial plants, and slow rates of seedling growth in the understory, combined with relatively low rates of seedling mortality. Consequently, there is a continuum of sizes among the individuals of the dominant species, and a lack of reliance on gaps for establishment.},

	Abstract = {Human activities, such as mining, forestry, and agriculture, strongly influence processes in natural systems. Because conservation has focused on managing and protecting wildlands, research has focused on understanding the indirect influence of these human activities on wildlands. Although a conservation focus on wildlands is critically important, the concept of residential area as an ecosystem is relatively new, and little is known about the potential of such areas to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. As urban sprawl increases, it becomes urgent to construct a method to research and improve the impacts of management strategies for residential landscapes. If the cumulative activities of individual property owners could help conserve biodiversity, then residential matrix management could become a critical piece of the conservation puzzle. "Citizen science" is a method of integrating public outreach and scientific data collection locally, regionally, and across large geographic scales. By involving citizen participants directly in monitoring and active management of residential lands, citizen science can generate powerful matrix management efforts, defying the "tyranny of small decisions" and leading to positive, cumulative, and measurable impacts on biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image-and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games(1-3), but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology(4), while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

	Abstract = {Mast seeding, the synchronous seed production by plants at irregular intervals, has been widely studied from the perspective of its fitness benefits, but much less is known about the proximate factors that cause plants to reproduce synchronously. In this article, I follow up on more than two decades of research investigating proximate mechanisms of mast seeding by Astragalus scaphoides, an iteroparous perennial forb. We use long-term monitoring in relation to two environmental manipulations to evaluate the importance of exogenous environmental factors versus endogenous feedbacks for synchrony in this species. Our past research showed that synchrony in this species is explained by the pollen-coupling hypothesis: plants that flower synchronously set seed and deplete stored resources, whereas plants that happen to flower asynchronously are pollen limited, set fewer seeds, and do not deplete resources, and flower again until they are resynchronized. Continued monitoring of two experimental manipulations, water addition, and flower removal, provides additional support for this model, and also reveals subtle effects of water availability on synchrony. Water addition decreased flowering, rather than increasing it as expected based on simple correlations with weather variables, suggesting that precipitation does not synchronize reproduction. Exogenous drivers are generally considered to be the primary synchronizing factors in plant reproduction. Our work in this system suggests that endogenous feedbacks may be more important than has been previously assumed.},

	Abstract = {Uncertainty associated with ecological forecasts has long been recognized, but forecast accuracy is rarely quantified. We evaluated how well data on 82 populations of 20 species of plants spanning 3 continents explained and predicted plant population dynamics. We parameterized stage-based matrix models with demographic data from individually marked plants and determined how well these models forecast population sizes observed at least 5 years into the future. Simple demographic models forecasted population dynamics poorly; only 40% of observed population sizes fell within our forecasts' 95% confidence limits. However, these models explained population dynamics during the years in which data were collected; observed changes in population size during the data-collection period were strongly positively correlated with population growth rate. Thus, these models are at least a sound way to quantify population status. Poor forecasts were not associated with the number of individual plants or years of data. We tested whether vital rates were density dependent and found both positive and negative density dependence. However, density dependence was not associated with forecast error. Forecast error was significantly associated with environmental differences between the data collection and forecast periods. To forecast population fates, more detailed models, such as those that project how environments are likely to change and how these changes will affect population dynamics, may be needed. Such detailed models are not always feasible. Thus, it may be wiser to make risk-averse decisions than to expect precise forecasts from models. Habilidad de los Modelos Matriciales para Explicar el Pasado y Predecir el Futuro de las Poblaciones de Plantas Resumen La incertidumbre asociada con el pronostico ecologico ha sido reconocida durante un largo tiempo pero rara vez se cuantifica su seguridad. Evaluamos que tan bien la informacion de 82 poblaciones de 20 especies de plantas a lo largo de 3 continentes explica y predice la dinamica de poblacion de las plantas. Realizamos parametros con modelos matriciales con base en estadios con datos demograficos a partir de plantas marcadas individualmente y determinamos que tan bien estos modelos pronostican el tamano de las poblaciones al menos 5 anos en el futuro. Los modelos demograficos simples pronosticaron pobremente las dinamicas de poblacion; solamente el 40% de las poblaciones observadas cayo dentro de los limites de confianza de 85% de nuestros pronosticos. Estos modelos sin embargo explicaron la dinamica de poblacion a lo largo de los anos en los que se colectaron datos; los cambios observados en el tamano de la poblacion durante el periodo de colecta de datos estuvieron positivamente correlacionados con la tasa de crecimiento de la poblacion. Asi, estos modelos son por lo menos una manera segura de cuantificar el estado de la poblacion. Los pronosticos debiles no estuvieron asociados con el numero de plantas individuales o con los anos de datos. Probamos si las tasas vitales dependian de la densidad y encontramos que existe dependencia hacia la densidad tanto positiva como negativa, sin embargo la dependencia de densidad no se asocio con el error de pronostico. El error de pronostico estuvo significativamente asociado con diferencias ambientales entre la recoleccion de datos y los periodos de pronostico. Para predecir el destino de las poblaciones se necesitan modelos mas detallados, como aquellos que proyectan los cambios probables en el ambiente y como estos cambios afectaran a la dinamica de las poblaciones. Tales modelos tan detallados no siempre son factibles. Por ello puede ser mejor tomar decisiones aversas a riesgos que esperar pronosticos precisos de los modelos.},

However, the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews, most studies of plant populations are based on < 5 matrices and present simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and longer studies. Therefore, in addition to longer term studies with better links to environmental drivers, priorities for research include critically evaluating relative/comparative uses of matrix models and asking how we can use many short-term studies to understand long-term population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Captive rearing is increasingly used as an interim strategy to maintain at-risk butterfly populations while long-term recovery techniques are developed. However, it is seldom feasible to measure effects of captive rearing on small, fragile, and highly mobile organisms, such as butterflies, in wild populations. We use a series of general population viability models to assess the demographic effects of a number of captive rearing strategies, defined by the source of butterflies brought into captivity (the at-risk "small" population vs. a different, stable "large" population) and the number brought into captivity. In general, captive rearing increases population viability, although the benefits are small for rapidly declining or highly stochastic populations. Taking butterflies from the large population is consistently better than taking butterflies from the small population, as long as the large population is not also at imminent risk of extinction. We then modify these models to include two possible risks of captive rearing: captive-reared individuals might not perform as well as wild individuals, and captive-reared individuals might decrease the population growth rate of the wild population, e.g., by introducing deleterious alleles or diseases. Reductions in individual performance do not change optimal captive rearing strategies. Short-term extinction risk is also robust to small (less than or similar to 5%) reductions in population growth rate. Although studying performance of captive-reared individuals in the wild is often not feasible, it is often possible to monitor performance while in captivity. Captive rearing is a robust way to maintain severely at-risk populations in the short-term, though it cannot replace long-term solutions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Several recent studies point out an intriguing and distinctive looping behavior by butterflies at habitat patch edges and hypothesize that this behavior requires a new framework for analyzing animal movement. We show that this looping behavior could be caused by a longstanding movement model, biased correlated random walk, with bias toward habitat patches. The ability of this longstanding model to explain recent observations reinforces the point that butterflies respond to habitat heterogeneity and do not move randomly through heterogeneous environments. We discuss the implications of different movement models for predicting butterfly responses to landscape change, and our rationale for retaining longstanding movement models, rather than developing new modeling frameworks for looping behavior at patch edges.},

	Abstract = {Our ability to predict ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and range limits. The warming trend over the past half-century has generated numerous opportunities to develop much-needed case studies of these links. Species that are only limited by climatic factors are likely to shift range quickly during periods of warming. Such species directly impact recipient communities and indicate trends that will become more widespread. Because minimum temperature (T-min) is rising at twice the rate of maximum temperature, species with this range-limiting factor may be especially responsive to global warming. In this study, I test the hypothesis that rising T-min has directly affected the range of a skipper butterfly. Atalopedes campestris has moved northward rapidly this century, recently colonizing eastern Washington where January T-min has risen 3degreesC in 50 years. The results show that:

1. A. campestris' range lies completely within the -4degreesC January average minimum isotherm, and that recently colonized areas were below this threshold earlier this century.

2. In acute cold stress experiments, -4 to -7degreesC proved to be a critical thermal limit: median supercooling point was -6.3degreesC, and minimum lethal temperature (LT50 with 12-h exposure) was -5.7degreesC.

3. In chronic cold stress experiments, survivorship declined sharply in diurnally fluctuating thermal regimes typical of the current range edge. High mortality occurred under constant 0degreesC conditions as well as in fluctuating regimes, implying that thermal insulation from snow would not protect A. campestris.

4. There was no evidence of evolution in cold tolerance at the range margin, despite strong selection. Thus, winter warming was apparently a prerequisite for the range expansion. Characteristics of this species that seem to be associated with its rapid response are that it is an opportunistic species, it is not habitat or dispersal limited, and it is constrained by T-min.},

	Abstract = {s the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.},

We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i. e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.},

	Abstract = {Habitat conditions mediate the effects of climate, so neighboring populations with differing habitat conditions may differ in their responses to climate change. We have previously observed that juvenile survival in Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon is strongly correlated with summer temperature in some populations and with fall streamflow in others. Here, we explore potential differential responses of the viability of four of these populations to changes in streamflow and temperature that might result from climate change. First, we linked predicted changes in air temperature and precipitation from several General Circulation Models to a local hydrological model to project streamflow and air temperature under two climate-change scenarios. Then, we developed a stochastic, density-dependent life-cycle model with independent environmental effects in juvenile and ocean stages, and parameterized the model for each population. We found that mean abundance decreased 20-50% and the probability of quasi-extinction increased dramatically (from 0.1-0.4 to 0.3-0.9) for all populations in both scenarios. Differences between populations were greater in the more moderate climate scenario than in the more extreme, hot/dry scenario. Model results were relatively robust to realistic uncertainty in freshwater survival parameters in all scenarios. Our results demonstrate that detailed population models can usefully incorporate climate-change predictions, and that global warming poses a direct threat to freshwater stages in these fish, increasing their risk of extinction. Because differences in habitat may contribute to the individualistic population responses we observed, we infer that maintaining habitat diversity will help buffer some species from the impacts of climate change.},

	Abstract = {A conceptual model of movement ecology has recently been advanced to explain all movement by considering the interaction of four elements: internal state, motion capacity, navigation capacities, and external factors. We modified this framework to generate predictions for species richness dynamics of fragmented plant communities and tested them in experimental landscapes across a 7-year time series. We found that two external factors, dispersal vectors and habitat features, affected species colonization and recolonization in habitat fragments and their effects varied and depended on motion capacity. Bird-dispersed species richness showed connectivity effects that reached an asymptote over time, but no edge effects, whereas wind-dispersed species richness showed steadily accumulating edge and connectivity effects, with no indication of an asymptote. Unassisted species also showed increasing differences caused by connectivity over time, whereas edges had no effect. Our limited use of proxies for movement ecology (e. g., dispersal mode as a proxy for motion capacity) resulted in moderate predictive power for communities and, in some cases, highlighted the importance of a more complete understanding of movement ecology for predicting how landscape conservation actions affect plant community dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Recreational angling is a popular leisure activity, the quality of which is greatly dependent on fish abundance and well-functioning aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic protected areas (APAs) are used to help maintain and even restore aquatic systems and their associated biota, including fish species that are popular with recreational anglers. Paradoxically, the use of APAs has been a source of much contention and conflict between members of the recreational angling community and those interested in or mandated to protect aquatic resources on the basis of the interests of multiple stakeholder groups. The angling community is concerned about the loss of fishing opportunities and effectiveness of APAs. Although it is still unclear whether establishment of APAs alone can effectively protect aquatic resources, actively including the recreational angling community in the design, implementation, and management of APAs will help ensure the values of this rather substantial user group are incorporated into aquatic conservation strategies. Conversely, the probability of increasing the sustainability of recreational angling and related economies will be greatest if recreational angler groups remain open minded to both short-term and long-term goals of fisheries conservation strategies, including the use of APAs.},

	Abstract = {Competition is a well-documented contributor to tree mortality in temperate forests, with numerous studies documenting a relationship between tree death and the competitive environment. Models frequently rely on competition as the only non-random mechanism affecting tree mortality. However, for mature forests, competition may cease to be the primary driver of mortality. We use a large, long-term dataset to study the importance of competition in determining tree mortality in old-growth forests on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A. We make use of the comparative spatial configuration of dead and live trees, changes in tree spatial pattern through time, and field assessments of contributors to an individual tree's death to quantify competitive effects. Competition was apparently a significant contributor to tree mortality in these forests. Trees that died tended to be in more competitive environments than trees that survived, and suppression frequently appeared as a factor contributing to mortality. On the other hand, based on spatial pattern analyses, only three of 14 plots demonstrated compelling evidence that competition was dominating mortality. Most of the rest of the plots fell within the expectation for random mortality, and three fit neither the random nor the competition model. These results suggest that while competition is often playing a significant role in tree mortality processes in these forests it only infrequently governs those processes. In addition, the field assessments indicated a substantial presence of biotic mortality agents in trees that died. While competition is almost certainly important, demographics in these forests cannot accurately be characterized without a better grasp of other mortality processes. In particular, we likely need a better understanding of biotic agents and their interactions with one another and with competition. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Climate change has resulted in major changes in the phenology-i.e. the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering and bird migration-of some species but not others. These differential responses have been shown to result in ecological mismatches that can have negative fitness consequences. However, the ways in which climate change has shaped changes in biodiversity within and across communities are not well understood. Here, we build on our previous results that established a link between plant species' phenological response to climate change and a phylogenetic bias in species' decline in the eastern United States. We extend a similar approach to plant and bird communities in the United States and the UK that further demonstrates that climate change has differentially impacted species based on their phylogenetic relatedness and shared phenological responses. In plants, phenological responses to climate change are often shared among closely related species (i.e. clades), even between geographically disjunct communities. And in some cases, this has resulted in a phylogenetically biased pattern of non-native species success. In birds, the pattern of decline is phylogenetically biased but is not solely explained by phenological response, which suggests that other traits may better explain this pattern. These results illustrate the ways in which phylogenetic thinking can aid in making generalizations of practical importance and enhance efforts to predict species' responses to future climate change.},

	Abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar, patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

Location Worldwide. Methods We first set a general framework highlighting the prerequisites of a relevant dataset for conservation biogeography. We then illustrate how many different citizen science programmes currently running in different countries can be placed within this framework. Results We highlight that citizen science is particularly useful to address issues spanning large temporal and spatial extents. We then show how datasets based on citizen science can be used to investigate major aspects of global change impacts on biodiversity. We further highlight why these programmes are also particularly valuable in developing the preventative and educational component of conservation biogeography. Main conclusions Conservation biogeography requires considerable amounts of data collected over large spatial and/or temporal extents. Beyond increasing technical advances to collect and analyse these data, citizen science seems to be a highly valuable tool in many aspects. However, while citizen science programmes are now popular and increasingly used in several countries, they are lacking in many others. We argue that the development of citizen science programmes should be encouraged as they can both be highly valuable for conservation biogeography and promote the reconnection between people and nature and more generally between people and science.},

	Abstract = {The concepts by which MacArthur and Wilson have transformed the science of ecology in the past decade, and the results of ecological studies such as mine on New Guinea bird communities, have implications for conservation policies. For example, primary tropical rain forest, the most species-rich and ecologically complex habitat on earth, has for millions of years served as the ultimate evolutionary source of the world's dominant plant and animal groups. Throughout the tropics today, the rain forests are being destroyed at a rate such that little will be left in a few decades. When the rain forests have been reduced to isolated tracts separated by open country, the distribution of obligate rain forest species will come to resemble bird distributions on New Guinea land-bridge islands after severing of the land bridges. The smaller the tract, the more rapidly will forest species tend to disappear and be replaced by the widespread second-growth species that least need protection (13). This ominous process is illustrated by Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an island when construction of the Panama Canal flooded surrounding valleys to create Gatun Lake. In the succeeding 60 years several forest bird species have already disappeared from Barro Colorado and been unable to recolonize across the short intervening water gap from the forest on the nearby shore of Gatun Lake. The consequences of the species-area relation (Fig. 1) should be taken into consideration during the planning of tropical rain forest parks (13). In a geographical area that is relatively homogeneous with regard to the fauna, one large park would be preferable to an equivalent area in the form of several smaller parks. Continuous nonforest strips through the park (for example, wide highway swaths) would convert one rain forest "island" into two half-size islands and should be avoided. If other considerations require that an area be divided into several small parks, connecting them by forest corridors might significantly improve their conservation function at little further cost in land withdrawn from development. Modern ecological studies may also be relevant to the understanding of human populations. For instance, during a long period of human evolution there appear to have been not one but two coexistent hominid lines in Africa, the Australopithecus robustus-A. boisei ("Zinjanthropus") line, which became extinct, and the Australopithecus africanus-A. habilis line, which led to Homo sapiens (27). The need to maintain niche differences between these lines must have provided one of the most important selective pressures on the ancestors of modern man in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Thus, any attempt to understand human evolution must confront the problem of what these ecological segregating mechanisms were. To what extent were contemporaneous species of the two lines separated by habitat, by diet, by size difference, or by foraging technique, and were their local spatial distributions broadly overlapping or else sharpened by behavioral interactions as in the case of the Crateroscelis warblers of Fig. 6? To take another example, there are striking parallels between the present distributions of human populations and of bird populations on the islands of Vitiaz and Dampier straits between New Guinea and New Britain. Some of these islands were sterilized by cataclysmic volcanic explosions within the last several centuries. The birds that recolonized these islands have been characterized as coastal and small-island specialists of high reproductive potential, high dispersal powers, and low competitive ability, unlike the geographically closer, competitively superior, slowly dispersing, and breeding birds of mainland New Guinea (10, 11, 13). It remains to be seen whether the people of the Vitiaz-Dampier islands, the Polynesians, and other human populations that colonize insular or unstable habitats also have distinctive population ecologies.},

However, new ocean technologies are being effectively used to increase the variety and numbers of sampled variables and thus to fill in the gaps of the time-space continuum of interdisciplinary ocean observations.

	Abstract = {Establishing what are the underlying causes of species range limits is of fundamental interest in ecology. We followed the fate of individually mapped plants of three endemic New Zealand high-alpine species of Myosotis, over a period of 9 years. The species provide contrasts in their geographical range and their demography. Myosotis oreophila Petrie is rare and extremely localized (c. 0.5 ha extent), Myosotis cheesemanii Petrie is regionally endemic, and Myosotis pulvinaris Hook. f. is more widespread. All three occur on the Dunstan Mountains, Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand within a 1-km radius, and individual plants were followed in four permanent plots. The three species differed in their longevity and in population variability, with the most widespread species (M. pulvinaris) having the lowest survival (61% per year), the fewest old plants (only 3% of plants present in 1993 surviving until 2001), no increase in survival rates with age, and the most variability in total numbers across years. Both of the rare species, M. oreophila and M. cheesemanii, had higher survival (75% and 88%, respectively, per year) especially for older plants, many older plants (20% and 59%, respectively, of 1993 plants surviving until 2001), and lower variability in total numbers across years. These results are consistent with other studies showing that rare plant species tend to have higher inertia than more common congeners. The range limits of M. oreophila showed a high level of spatial constancy on a scale of metres over the 9 years, despite 80% turnover in plants during that time. The M. oreophila population showed lower mean densities of plants near to the population boundaries, identical age-specific survival rates, but lower flowering probabilities, than the core of the population. We were unable to detect any abiotic differences between inside and outside the M. oreophila range in terms of topography, soil parent materials, microclimate or through manipulation of snow cover. Disturbance may be a factor affecting the distribution of M. cheesemanii but limiting factors for M. oreophila and M. pulvinaris are likely to be biotic (competition, seed limitation, dispersal capacity) and/or historic. Further experimentation is recommended.},

	Abstract = {Despite intensive research, we still have no general understanding of why plant invasions occur. Many different mechanisms of plant invasions have been proposed, but studies designed to investigate them often produce inconsistent results. It remains unclear whether this unsatisfying state of affairs reflects the complexity of the real world (in which every invasion is unique) or the failure to identify the key processes driving most plant invasions. Here we argue that greater generalization is possible, but only if we recognize that the ecological and evolutionary processes enabling a species to advance into a new area change during the course of an invasion. In our view, an invasion can often usefully be subdivided into a primary phase, in which the abundance of an often preadapted species increases rapidly (typically in resource-rich, disturbed habitats), and a secondary phase, in which further spread is contingent upon plastic responses or genetic adaptation to new ecological circumstances. We present various examples to show how this partitioning of the invasion phase sensu stricto produces new hypotheses about the processes underlying plant invasions. Some of these hypotheses can be conveniently tested by investigating plant invasions along strong environmental gradients such as those that occur in mountainous regions.},

We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants. Different functional groups also varied considerably in their sensitivity to environmental drivers.

The profile shapes were found to be a function of source characteristics and meteorological conditions. Changes in profile shape were in general agreement to those found in previous work.

Increasing evidence suggests that individual animals differ in their average level of behaviour displayed across a range of contexts (animal 'personality'), and in their responsiveness to environmental variation (plasticity), and that these phenomena can be considered complementary aspects of the individual phenotype. How should this complex variation be studied? Here, we outline how central ideas in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics can be combined within a single framework based on the concept of 'behavioural reaction norms'. This integrative approach facilitates analysis of phenomena usually studied separately in terms of personality and plasticity, thereby enhancing understanding of their adaptive nature.},

	Abstract = {The desert tortoise is a threatened species living in the deserts of the American Southwest. Using size-structured demographic models, we analyzed the status of the tortoise in the Western Mojave desert and evaluated the effectiveness of possible management measures. Our demographic analyses agree with the trends reported by field censuses in showing rapid population decline. Importantly, simulations that include variation and correlation in vital rates yield highly variable forecasts of population growth, indicating the uncertainties inherent in even short-term projections of tortoise population sizes. To determine where conservation efforts and data collection should be focused, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses in which the effects of changing different vital rates were quantified. We found that the rate of population growth is most sensitive to the survival of large adult females and that improving survival of this size class to reputably ''pristine'' rates could reverse population declines; in contrast, large improvements in other vital rates will not, alone, reverse population decline. Thus, shooting, off-road vehicles, upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), and other major sources of adult mortality should be the primary focus of management strategies. Finally, we discuss the impact of the proposed expansion of the U.S. Army's Fort Irwin, which would reduce the Western Mojave tortoise population by less-than-or-equal-to 13%. We argue that the expansion could have a grave impact on the long-term population viability of the tortoise, but that this impact will be a function of the management of remaining tortoise habitat. We conclude that, although many anthropogenic impacts threaten the tortoise, the species' future could be bright, provided that research and land-use planning focus on biologically important aspects of its life history.},

	Abstract = {To persist, species are expected to shift their geographical ranges polewards or to higher elevations as the Earth's climate warms(1-4). However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions(5-11). Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.},

	Abstract = {The response of tropical forests to global climate variability and change remains poorly understood. Results from long-term studies of permanent forest plots have reported different, and in some cases opposing trends in tropical forest dynamics. In this study, we examined changes in tree growth rates at four long-term permanent tropical forest research plots in relation to variation in solar radiation, temperature and precipitation. Temporal variation in the stand-level growth rates measured at five-year intervals was found to be positively correlated with variation in incoming solar radiation and negatively related to temporal variation in night-time temperatures. Taken alone, neither solar radiation variability nor the effects of night-time temperatures can account for the observed temporal variation in tree growth rates across sites, but when considered together, these two climate variables account for most of the observed temporal variability in tree growth rates. Further analysis indicates that the stand-level response is primarily driven by the responses of smaller-sized trees (less than 20 cm in diameter). The combined temperature and radiation responses identified in this study provide a potential explanation for the conflicting patterns in tree growth rates found in previous studies.},

	Abstract = {Elevated ocean temperatures can cause coral bleaching, the loss of colour from reef-building corals because of a breakdown of the symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM. First, we develop and test algorithms for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperatures for thousands of coral reefs, using a global coral reef map and 1985-2002 bleaching prediction data. We then use the algorithms to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by corals and their endosymbionts under two different emissions scenarios. The results indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world's coral reefs in the next 30-50 years without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2-1.0 degrees C per decade. The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emissions scenario suggests that coral reefs in some regions, like Micronesia and western Polynesia, may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reefs, but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.},

	Abstract = {Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented previously large areas of habitat. Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens form a significant component of urban green space in many cities and therefore could play a role in redressing this problem. Our ecological and social scientific study examined factors influencing the dispersal and regeneration of 12 bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton Bush, a 7.8 ha urban forest remnant, into surrounding residential properties in Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 125 years, the reported number of native vascular plant species in the Bush has declined by a third. Some species, particularly Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, the dominant woody species in the Bush, are being dispersed by birds and establishing in residential gardens predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin. These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to remove all non-planted woody species. This suggests natural potential for regeneration exists but is insufficient without active human intervention. Our survey results show people are supportive of native plants in general but lack knowledge of the species. They are willing to plant locally appropriate woody species if provided with plants, information, and, most importantly, control over the location of plantings. Residential gardens consequently have the potential to play a major role in the conservation of urban biodiversity especially for species suited to the functions and size of gardens.},

	Abstract = {The class of N-mixture models allows abundance to be estimated from repeated, point count surveys while adjusting for imperfect detection of individuals. We developed an extension of N-mixture models to account for two commonly observed phenomena in point count surveys: rarity and lack of independence induced by unmeasurable sources of variation in the detectability of individuals. Rarity increases the number of locations with zero detections in excess of those expected under simple models of abundance (e.g., Poisson or negative binomial). Correlated behavior of individuals and other phenomena, though difficult to measure, increases the variation in detection probabilities among surveys. Our extension of N-mixture models includes a hurdle model of abundance and a beta-binomial model of detectability that accounts for additional (extra-binomial) sources of variation in detections among surveys. As an illustration, we fit this model to repeated point counts of the West Indian manatee, which was observed in a pilot study using aerial surveys. Our extension of N-mixture models provides increased flexibility. The effects of different sets of covariates may be estimated for the probability of occurrence of a species, for its mean abundance at occupied locations, and for its detectability.},

	Abstract = {Competition among plants in extreme environments such as the High Arctic has often been described as unimportant, or even nonexistent; environmental factors are thought to overrule any negative plant-plant interactions. However, few studies have actually addressed this question experimentally in the Arctic, and those that did found only little evidence for competition. Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra. These two divergent scenarios would have different implications for ecosystem feedbacks to climatic change.},

	Abstract = {Species that depend on ephemeral habitat often evolve distinct dispersal strategies in which the propensity to disperse is closely integrated with a suite of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits that influence colonizing ability. These strategies are maintained by natural selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the maternal generation and variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia mexicana) dependence on nest cavities-an ephemeral resource has led to the evolution of two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity. Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show experimentally that the association between resource availability and sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion.},

	Abstract = {In species undergoing range expansion, newly established populations are often more dispersive than older populations. Because dispersal phenotypes are complex and often costly, it is unclear how highly dispersive phenotypes are maintained in a species to enable their rapid expression during periods of range expansion. Here I test the idea that metapopulation dynamics of local extinction and recolonization maintain distinct dispersal strategies outside the context of range expansion. Western bluebirds display distinct dispersal phenotypes where aggressive males are more dispersive than nonaggressive males, resulting in highly aggressive populations at the edge of their expanding range. I experimentally created new habitat interior to the range edge to show that, as on the range front, it was colonized solely by aggressive males. Moreover, fitness consequences of aggression depended on population age: aggressive males had high fitness when colonizing new populations, while nonaggressive males performed best in an older population. These results suggest that distinct dispersal strategies were maintained before range expansion as an adaptation for the continual recolonization of new habitat. These results emphasize similarities between range expansion and metapopulation dynamics and suggest that preexisting adaptive dispersal strategies may explain rapid changes in dispersal phenotypes during range expansion.},

	Abstract = {The importance of inbreeding depression in theoretical considerations of mating-system evolution(1-5) and its potential impact on the persistence of small populations(6) has renewed interest in the genetic basis of this phenomenon. Inbreeding increases homozygosity. This can produce inbreeding depression for two different reasons: first, deleterious recessive or partially recessive alleles that are masked at heterozygous loci by dominant alleles become fully expressed in homozygotes; and second, alleles may interact in an overdominant manner, such that the fitness of either type of homozygote is lower than that of heterozygotes. These two mechanisms produce different long-term effects in populations experiencing increased levels of inbreeding. Inbreeding depression resulting from deleterious alleles can be removed by selection, but inbreeding: depression produced by overdominance cannot be removed without lowering the mean fitness of the population(1-5). Using a North Carolina 3 breeding progamme(7), the most powerful quantitative genetics technique available(8-10), we show here that deleterious recessive alleles are mainly responsible for inbreeding depression in two closely related annual plants, the primarily selfing Mimulus micranthus and the mixed-mating M.guttatus. Estimates indicate that deleterious alleles in dir micranthus are more nearly additive than they are in M. guttatus.},

	Abstract = {In the preservation of plant biodiversity, there are fundamental genetic and ecological similarities involved it]: (1) predicting the fate of small, isolated populations, (2) ensuring the successful reintroduction of endangered species back into natural habitats, and (3) understanding the establishment of species beyond their native ranges. In all three cases, populations small in size only experience high levels, of inbreeding and subsequently the expression of inbreeding depression. The ability of these populations to persist will depend, ill part on the magnitude of inbreeding depression and the ability of selection to remove (or purge) the genetic load that causes inbreeding depression. The loss of genetic variation caused by inbreeding or drift in these small populations Will restrict their evolutionary potential, placing a high premium on the ability of plants to respond plastically to environmental variation. When plants make appropriate phenotypic adjustments in truly novel environments while maintaining high fitness, we suggest the use of a new term, "opportunistic plasticity," for this attribute. Opportunistic plasticity may be particularly critical and advantageous in the case of plant introductions in ecological restoration where habitats resemble but are not identical to seed collection sites, or in the initial establishment phase of exotic species in non-native locations where many aspects of the environment differ from the native range. Overall phenotypic plasticity may also be all important weans of dealing with environmental heterogeneity in many small populations, but unfortunately we have limited data on the interaction between inbreeding and plasticity in plants. The science and practice of conservation biology has generally appreciated the importance of inbreeding, but we feel that it will benefit greatly by considering the potential interactions between inbreeding and phenotypic plasticity and their effects in the establishment and persistence of small populations.},

Here, we use a hybrid model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44-50% by the end of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most 'optimistic' static model (49%). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40% of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt(5,6). Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain plants.},

	Abstract = {Matrix population models require the population to be divided into discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the "integral projection model," which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rare, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves fur each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense). With individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, bur the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stags duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.},

The factors that drive this variability in the southern limit were examined by: (1) quantifying the abundances of M. pyrifera and the subsurface stipitate kelp, Eisenia arborea (Areschoug), near M. pyrifera's then southern limit at Punta San Roque (27&DEG; 15'N; 114&DEG; 42'W) on ten occasions between August 1997 and June 2002 (prior to and following the 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation); (2) initiating a field manipulation at Punta San Roque in June 2000 to examine competition between these two kelp species; and (3) surveying 20 additional sites near Punta San Hipolito (27&DEG; 01'N; 114&DEG; 00'W) in June 2002 to determine whether M. pyrifera populations had recovered to their pre-1982/1983 El Nino southern range limit after &SIM; 20 years of absence. These observations and the experimental results suggest that M. pyrifera is removed from its southern limit by the high temperatures and large waves associated with El Ninos, while E. arborea is able to survive and recruit in high densities and thereby delay or even prevent M. pyrifera's recovery. An inverse relationship was observed between these two species over the 5-year study. The field experiment showed that at both 4 months and 1 year after areas occupied by E. arborea were cleared, substantial recruitment of M. pyrifera occurred, while recruitment was negligible in uncleared areas. This study suggests that the southern range limit of M. pyrifera is determined by increased mortality and recruitment failure following the warm temperatures and low nutrient conditions associated with El Ninos, limited substrate availability, and by competition with the more persistent populations of E. arborea.},

	Abstract = {Disturbances, such as flooding, play important roles in determining community structure. Most studies of disturbances focus on the direct effects and, hence, the indirect effects of disturbances are poorly understood. Within terrestrial riparian areas, annual flooding leads to differences in the arthropod community as compared to non-flooded areas. In turn, these differences are likely to alter the survival, growth, and reproduction of plant species via an indirect effect of flooding (i.e., changes in herbivory patterns). To test for such effects, an experiment was conducted wherein arthropod predators and herbivores were excluded from plots in flooded and non-flooded areas and the impact on a common riparian plant, Mimulus guttatus was examined. In general, the direct effect of flooding on M. guttatus was positive. The indirect effects, however, significantly decreased plant survival for both years of the experiment, regardless of predator presence, because of an increased exposure to grasshoppers, the most abundant herbivore in the non-flooded sites. Leafhoppers, which were more abundant in the flooded sites, had much weaker and varying effects. During 2000, when the leafhopper herbivory was high, arthropod predators did not significantly reduce damage to plants. In 2001, the mean herbivory damage was lower and predators were able to significantly reduce overall leafhopper damage. The effects of predators on leafhoppers, however, did not increase plant survival, final weight, or the reproduction potential and, thus, did not initiate a species-level trophic cascade. Overall, it was the differences in the herbivore community that led to a significant decrease in plant survival. While flooding certainly alters riparian plant survival through direct abiotic effects, it also indirectly affects riparian plants by changing the arthropod community, in particular herbivores, and hence trophic interactions.},

	Abstract = {Alteration of riparian stream flow through the damming of rivers and streams impacts not only river morphology but also the vegetation communities that exist within the confines of a river's banks. To examine changes in vegetation community composition and structure resulting from human control of water flow, I conducted a series of surveys on dammed and undammed streams in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These surveys documented that areas below dams contain increased leaf litter and, grass thatch deposition, increased grass species coverage, and an altered community of existing forbs as compared to sites with naturally flowing streams. There was also an increased woody species canopy coverage as distance from the stream increased. To examine the proximal causes of damming on herbaceous plants, I set up a factorial field experiment examining the impact of grass thatch, shading, and herbivory on a common riparian species, Mimulus guttatus, the common monkeyflower. M. guttatus germination was decreased in the thatch augmentation plots and under artificial shading. For seedlings, shading increased final plant height and thatch increased herbivory. In plots where herbivory was not controlled by insecticide, M. guttatus plants grew smaller and had lower reproduction. I also repeated this experiment in a more controlled greenhouse environment using two seed sources and two levels of shading coverage. Results from this experiment largely confirm patterns seen in the field, but also revealed a strong interaction between shading and thatch treatments for both germination and growth. Overall, my results suggest that altering riparian stream flow may impact plant performance through a cascading set of biotic interactions, and that controlled releases from dams that mimic bankfull or greater discharge events may be required to restore these important and diverse communities by resetting disturbance rates.},

	Abstract = {Competition, trophic interactions and abiotic disturbances play important roles in governing plant population dynamics, yet few studies have addressed their relative contributions or interacting effects. We used Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) analysis, coupled with stochastic analyses, to examine how a major abiotic disturbance, flooding, influences the fitness and population growth of a common riparian plant, Mimulus guttatus, and how this effect compares and interacts with that exerted by herbivory. We also extended LTRE analysis to include nested factors, which enabled us to examine differences across experimental sites. These spatial contributions to changes in population growth rate, lambda, were compared and contrasted with those derived for year and experimental treatments. Flooding had direct positive impacts on population growth, while protection from herbivory benefited plants in both flooded and non-flooded areas. Spatial variation in plant performance was also substantial, with greater variation across experimental sites than temporal variation across years. Our stochastic analysis revealed that the impact of herbivores on population growth was much greater when the environment fluctuated between years with and without flooding than in more constant environments. Both flooding and herbivory exerted the majority of their impacts on plant performance via changes in adult summer survival. For flooded sites, this was surprising, given the small difference in summer survival between control and herbivore-exclusion treatments, and results from the high sensitivity of population growth to adult survival. The importance of herbivory in flooded sites would have not been discerned had we not considered how adult survival interacts with other stages of the M. guttatus life cycle. Thus, in order to increase ecological understanding associated with shifts in community dynamics, experimental results should be placed in a life-history context. Within disturbance-driven systems, the direct abiotic effects of factors such as flooding play a critical role in determining population dynamics. However, the biotic interactions that change as a consequence of disturbance can have equal and lasting impacts on population growth.},

	Abstract = {Most populations exist in variable environments. Two sets of theory have been developed to address this variability. Stochastic dynamics focus on variation in population growth rates based on random differences in vital rates such as growth, survival, and reproduction. Transient dynamics focus on short-term, deterministic responses to changes in the stage distribution of individuals. These processes are related: demographic variation shifts stage structures, producing transient responses, which then contribute to the overall variability of population growth rate. The relative contributions of vital rates vs. transient responses to stochastic dynamics, and the implications for transient analyses, are unclear. This study explores the role of transient responses in stochastic dynamics of nine perennial plant species. Across the species, transient responses contributed more on average to variability in annual population growth rates than did variation in vital rates alone. Transient potential of an average matrix was indicative of the contribution of transient dynamics, although these metrics varied greatly across years. Transient responses were often in the opposite direction as demographic variation, suggesting that transient dynamics may at times have a buffering effect on populations. Overall, transient dynamics had an important role in modulating environmental variation, with implications for both processes in understanding stochastic dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The process of taxonomic description and validation of names under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Fourth Edition) is central to providing the anchor by which present and future seekers of knowledge attach and subsequently retrieve information about species and their phylogenetic associations. Since Linnaeus (1758), 4,400 +/- 363 species of insects have been described per year. If 25 to 30% of all species are beetles, and some 400,000 are estimated to be described to date, even taking the lower end of reasonable estimates at 8 to 10 million species of insects total, we still have more than 2 million beetle species yet to describe. At the current pace of some 3,154 beetle species described per year (1978 to present: BIOSIS, Zoological Record), we could "finish" the job in the year 3056 using the present system. While traditional descriptions published in widely circulated journals has been the mainstay of taxonomy and served the science well, we are entering a phase that might be called crisis management in taxonomy. This results from recent higher demands on taxonomists due to a general recognition that biodiversity is disappearing at an alarming rate, the so-called Sixth Extinction Crisis, and a reduced number of practicing descriptive taxonomists. Therefore, a new description paradigm that provides for rapid validation of new taxonomic names is paramount to plans for national biodiversity surveys. This new paradigm is elaborated and examples are given for both traditional and projected methods of species descriptions and rapid publication with additional extensive use of the Internet and server system to store and transmit more complete details and images.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary response to regional and global climate change may vary in widespread polymorphic species, so predicting future genetic responses will require careful tracking of genetic variability in local populations. We surveyed chromosomal inversion polymorphisms in 25 populations of Drosophila robusta, many of which have been sampled repeatedly starting in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s up until 2007, across its range in the USA. Frequencies of some northerly, or cold-adapted, gene arrangements have declined in the face of increasing temperatures, whereas frequencies of several southern, or warm-adapted, gene arrangements were positively correlated with increasing temperature changes. Over a finer geographic scale, populations from the west-central part of the species range from the Ozark Plateau, Ouachita mountains, and eastern Oklahoma showed genetic differentiation between south-central Ozark and western Ozark/Ouachita regions that has persisted in the face of recent shifts in gene arrangement frequencies. Overall, populations of D. robusta exhibited dynamic genetic changes over time, with some populations shifting chromosome frequencies in just 10-15 years. Some temporal genetic shifts were widespread and significantly correlated with temperature increases, but regions of the genome marked by different gene arrangements have responded in different sections of the species range. In some parts of the species range, chromosome frequencies shifted but were not associated with changing temperatures, showed little or no temporal change, or temporal shifts stopped for temperature sensitive gene arrangements near fixation.

	Abstract = {Premise of the study: The extent to which climate controls species' range limits is a classic biological question that is particularly relevant given anthropogenic climate change. While climate is known to play a role in species distributions, biotic interactions such as competition also affect range limits. Furthermore, climatic and biotic controls of ranges may vary in strength across life stages, implying complex range shift dynamics with climate change. Methods: We quantified climatic and competitive influences on growth of juvenile and adult trees of three conifer species on Mt. Rainier, Washington, United States. We collected annual growth data of these trees, which we compared to the competitive environment and annual climate (100 years of data) experienced by each individual. Key results: We found that the relationships between growth and climate and between growth and competition differed by life stage and location. Growth was sensitive to heavy snowpack and cold temperatures at high elevation upper limits (treeline), but growth was poorly explained by climate in low elevation closed-canopy forests. Competitive effects on growth were more important for saplings than adults, but did not become more important at either upper or lower range limits. Conclusions: In all, our results suggest that range shifts under climate change will differ at leading vs. trailing edges. At treeline, warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth and likely to range expansion. However, climate change will have less dramatic effects in low elevation closed-canopy forest communities, where growth is less strongly limited by climate, especially at young life stages.},

Starch gel electrophoresis was used to-resolve 15 isozyme loci from 9 populations on 3 mountains. First, we describe the genetic variation of these 9 populations in the Olympic Mountains, and compare these results to those of other tree species. Then we compare genetic differentiation (G(ST)) among populations to test if selective pressures alter genotypic frequencies in response to steep environmental gradients over the elevation range of this species. Genetic variation is relatively uniform throughout most of the sites sampled (H-0 range = 0.103-0.139 in the eastern Olympic Mountains), with notably lower diversity observed at the western extent of subalpine fir's range (H-0 = 0.70 in the central Olympic Mountains). Lower diversity in the western Olympics may result from either founder effects as the species expanded its range from a glacial refugium, or from selection pressures on the loci considered. Genetic differentiation is greater among high elevation sites on different mountains, than among different elevation sites on the same mountain, or lower elevation sites on different mountains. Estimates of gene flow (N-m = 7.8) are high among all sites.},

	Abstract = {Plants are often simultaneously attacked by insect herbivores and plant pathogens, yet relatively few studies have investigated the potential interactive effects of herbivores and pathogens on plant fitness. We studied the effects of simultaneous attack by meadow spittlebugs, Philaenus spumarius (Homoptera: Cercopidae), and a plant virus, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), on the fitness of Mimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae). We wanted to determine: (1) if trade-offs in defense against meadow spittlebugs and CMV exist, (2) if meadow spittlebugs and CMV interact to affect plant fitness, and (3) if genetic variation is associated with these interactive effects. We found no evidence of trade-offs in defense against meadow spittlebugs and CMV in M. guttatus in a greenhouse experiment. Thus, the ability of M. guttatus to defend itself against one of these enemies is unlikely to preclude the evolution of adequate defenses against the second enemy. We did, however, find strong evidence that spittlebugs and CMV interacted to affect plant fitness and that genetic variation underlies the degree and direction of this interaction. This suggests that selection can act on the genetic variation underlying the interaction between the two enemies and that strong selection imposed by one will alter the response of M. guttatus populations to the second. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate genetic variation associated with the non-additive effect of an herbivore and a pathogen on plant fitness. We suggest that future studies of the mechanisms underlying the defensive properties of plants need to consider variation associated with defense mechanisms and the potential effect of this variation on the response of plant populations to selection by multiple enemies.},

To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.},

	Abstract = {An integrated program of ecosystem modeling and field studies in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest ( U. S. A.) has quantified many of the ecological processes affected by climatic variability. Paleoecological and contemporary ecological data in forest ecosystems provided model parameterization and validation at broad spatial and temporal scales for tree growth, tree regeneration and treeline movement. For subalpine tree species, winter precipitation has a strong negative correlation with growth; this relationship is stronger at higher elevations and west-side sites ( which have more precipitation). Temperature affects tree growth at some locations with respect to length of growing season ( spring) and severity of drought at drier sites ( summer). Furthermore, variable but predictable climate-growth relationships across elevation gradients suggest that tree species respond differently to climate at different locations, making a uniform response of these species to future climatic change unlikely. Multi-decadal variability in climate also affects ecosystem processes. Mountain hemlock growth at high-elevation sites is negatively correlated with winter snow depth and positively correlated with the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. At low elevations, the reverse is true. Glacier mass balance and fire severity are also linked to PDO. Rapid establishment of trees in subalpine ecosystems during this century is increasing forest cover and reducing meadow cover at many subalpine locations in the western U. S. A. and precipitation ( snow depth) is a critical variable regulating conifer expansion. Lastly, modeling potential future ecosystem conditions suggests that increased climatic variability will result in increasing forest fire size and frequency, and reduced net primary productivity in drier, east-side forest ecosystems. As additional empirical data and modeling output become available, we will improve our ability to predict the effects of climatic change across a broad range of climates and mountain ecosystems in the northwestern U. S. A.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric pollen dispersal in the southern Rocky Mountains was sampled with 18 Tauber traps located between 2470 and 3780 m elevation. A three year study provided data on both pollen frequencies and pollen accumulation (grains cm-2 yr-1) for six distinct vegetation types. Pollen spectra from the shrub steppe below the forest belt is characterized by Artemisia, Gramineae, Compositae, and other non-arboreal pollen taxa. These pollen types are readily carried upslope to higher elevations. Pollen from sub-alpine conifers, Picea and Abies, is not transported far by the wind, and indicates the presence of nearby host trees. Pinus pollen, readily distributed by the wind, is found in all traps, but only exceeds 20% where the trees are present, and in tundra vegetation. While pollen from Pseudotsuga and Populus trees occurs in low frequencies and low influx rates, it is relatively abundant in montane forest stands dominated by these trees. Although pollen grains are transported both upslope and downslope, most pollen transport is upslope. At least 50% of the pollen deposited in alpine tundra, 20% in the sub-alpine forest, and 7% in the montane forest, comes from plants growing at lower elevations. Pollen spectra deposited in steppe vegetation are the least distorted by pollen from plants growing in other vegetation types, and characterize the broad valleys of sagebrush steppe that makes up the regional vegetation. Spectra in alpine tundra are dominated by pollen from plants growing at lower elevations and at long distances from the collection site. In a comparison of paired collectors, Tauber traps with aerodynamically designed lids were more effective in open vegetation where they collected substantially more pollen than traps without the lids. Tauber lids appear to have less effect on pollen accumulation rates in forested stands, probably due to the filtering of pollen by trees. Annual pollen accumulation rates in west-central Colorado range between 1000 and 5000 grains cm-2 yr-1. Mean rates of modem pollen influx (in grains cm-2 yr-1) are 1100 in alpine tundra, 2700 in the sub-alpine forest, 3400 in montane forest types, and 2200 in the shrub steppe. These pollen accumulation values reported for the mountains of Colorado are comparable to pollen accumulation rates from other localities in the western United States.},

	Abstract = {Although rare plant species are widely regarded as threatened by invasive plant species, few concrete data document the actual prevalence of invasives at sites with rare plant species. Data from comprehensive Conservation and Research Plans produced by the New England Wild Flower Society for 81 species of state-listed plants in New England provide quantitative information on the biogeographic distribution of invasive species where rare plants occur; their associations with multiple habitat variables and other threats; and hypothesized correlations with declines of rare plant populations. Eighteen invasive species were identified as co-occurring with rare plants; Lythrum salicaria was the most frequent and widespread. The spatial distribution of invasive species at rare plant sites paralleled large-scale patterns of both rare and invasive species richness and frequency throughout the region. However, invasive species occurred at only a subset of rare species sites, principally clustered along major rivers in New England. Connecticut reported the highest frequency and diversity of invasives, which declined with latitude. Invasives co-occurred with 38 (47%) of 81 rare species at 10.4% of 820 rare plant populations studied. For affected rare taxa, invasive species posed threats to a mean of 37.7% of their New England populations. Paired comparisons of invaded and uninvaded rare plant populations revealed a significant association of invasives with roads and with other anthropogenic threats. Populations of rare taxa in proximity to invasives showed higher (but statistically insignificant) rates of decline; classification analysis indicated that decline was best explained by the same habitat variables that were associated with invasive species presence, rather than by the presence of invasives alone. Thus, invasive species are both a direct threat and a symptom of larger landscape variables that influence the persistence of rare species.},

	Abstract = {Because it is virtually impossible to collect seed or tissue for ex situ conservation banks from every known population of rare plant species, it is important to rank populations systematically in terms of their priority for collection. The New England Wild Flower Society, which maintains a regional seed bank, developed a set of three complementary decision matrices in spreadsheet form by which to prioritize all occurrences of all state-listed rare plant species in New England in terms of their urgency and feasibility for collection. Data on 4333 occurrences, spanning 456 taxa, were collated from six state Natural Heritage Programs. The first decision matrix ranked taxa in terms of their amenability to storage or propagation at ex situ institutions, and determined whether any known New England occurrences were reproductive. The second matrix further ranked taxa in terms of their global and regional rarity and the viability and genetic and geographic representation of collections already present in the bank. The third matrix scored individual occurrences within each taxon in terms of the presence of imminent threat, reproductive status, vigor, protection status, potential genetic distance from other occurrences, availability of landowner permission, and their current status in the bank. Occurrences were then sorted in ascending order by total matrix score; those with low scores were at the top of the list for collection priority. 3743 occurrences were deemed eligible for collection. Scores ranged from 14.5 to 182, and were influenced most strongly by the number of occurrences per taxon. Clear breakpoints were apparent in the distribution of scores, with clusters of uncommon taxa at the low end of the scale and a long tail created by taxa with more numerous occurrences in New England. These breakpoints could potentially be used to prioritize groups of occurrences that should receive the first attention for collection, while postponing collection of higher-scoring groups. Fewer than 1% of occurrences were mis-classified, according to post hoc inspection. This simple set of decision matrices can be adapted by a wide range of institutions involved in ex situ conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {I apply a comparative, functional group approach to coastal sandplain grassland taxa in order to examine whether rare plant species share certain aspects of rarity and life history characters that are distinct from their more common, co-occurring congeners in these habitats. I compiled a comparative data set containing 16 variables describing biogeographic distributions, level of imperilment, habitat specialization, vegetative versus sexual reproduction, seed dispersal, and dormancy of 27 closely-related pairs of plant species that contrast in their abundance (infrequent versus common) in coastal sandplain grasslands. Frequent and infrequent species were paired within genera (or closely related genera) and thus distributed equivalently across families to control for phylogenetic bias. Paired comparisons revealed that infrequent species were intrinsically rarer range-wide, and exhibited a narrower range and more habitat specialization than their common relatives. A classification tree distinguished infrequent species from common species on the basis of higher habitat specialization, larger seed size, smaller plant height, less reliance less on vegetative (colonial) reproduction, and tendency toward annual or biennial life history. Research and management steps to reduce competition from larger-satured, colonial, perennial species are recommended for these infrequent species. Basic research involving more species and more data on ecophysiological characters, demography, and competitive interactions are needed to identify critical life history traits that will influence responses to particular management regimes.

	Abstract = {Comparative examination of a large sample of plant species can reveal important aspects of life history that influence the ecology and distribution of taxa and their vulnerability to local extinction. We investigated whether functional groups of 71 rare plant species with contrasting life history traits differed in terms of population losses over time, regional range contraction, and range-wide levels of imperilment. Using town-level occurrence data from herbaria and Natural Heritage Program databases, we characterized species' extents of occurrence as alpha-hulls encompassing the centroids of New England towns that contained well-documented populations of these rare taxa. Family affiliation was used as a covariate in analyses to reduce phylogenetic bias. Disparate functional groups of plants differed both in proportions of populations lost and declines in range areas over time, with insect-pollinated taxa, upland (vs. wetland) taxa, species with localized seed dispersal modes, and taxa reaching their northern range boundary in New England significantly more imperiled than other functional groups. These techniques permit a broad comparative assessment of the distribution of large numbers of plant taxa, so that we can identify several functional groups that warrant more concerted conservation attention.},

	Abstract = {Detecting range shifts and contractions is critical for determining the conservation priority of rare and declining taxa. However, data on rare species occurrences frequently lack precise information on locations and habitats and may present a biased picture of biogeographic distributions and presumed habitat preferences. Herbarium or museum specimen data, which otherwise could be useful proxies for detecting temporal trends and spatial patterns in species distributions, pose particular challenges. Using data from herbaria and Natural Heritage Programs on numbers of occurrences within individual municipalities (towns, cities, or townships), we quantified temporal changes in the estimated distributions of 110 rare plant species in the six New England (USA) states. We used the partial Solow equation and a nonparametric test to estimate the probability of observing multiple absences (gaps in the collection record) if a given population was actually still extant. Bayes' Theorem was used to estimate the probability that occurrences were misclassified as extinct. Using the probabilities obtained from these three methods, we eliminated taxa with high probabilities of pseudo-absence (that would yield an inaccurate profile of species distributions), narrowing the set for final analysis to 71 taxa. We then expressed occurrences as centroids of town polygons and estimated current and historical range areas (extents of occurrence as defined by alpha-hulls inscribing occurrences), mean distances between occurrences, and latitudinal and longitudinal range boundaries. Using a geographic information system, we modeled first; second, and third circular standard deviational polygons around the mean center of the historical range. Examining the distribution of current occurrences within each standard deviational polygon, we asked whether ranges were collapsing to a center, expanding, fragmenting, or contracting to a margin of the former range. Extant ranges of the species were, on average, almost 67% smaller than their historical ranges, and distances among occurrences decreased. Five New England hotspots were observed to contain > 35% of rare plant populations. Extant occurrences were more frequently marginalized at the periphery of the historical range than would be expected by chance. Coarse-grained data on current and historical occurrences can be used to examine large suites of species to prioritize taxa and sites for conservation.},

	Abstract = {We used two approaches to examine the role of natural selection in the evolution of selfing in Mimulus. First, using cpDNA and isozyme variation we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among a number of populations of two selfing (M. micranthus and M. laciniatus) and two outcrossing (M. guttatus and M. nasutus) species to determine the frequency of evolution of selfing within the genus. We hypothesized that the independent evolution of selfing taxa from outcrossing taxa would be strong evidence that the mating system is under the influence of natural selection. Second, we used phenotypic selection analysis to measure the presence and intensity of selection on floral characters associated with the mating system in extant populations of the outcrossing species M. guttatus. An unrooted Wagner tree constructed from cpDNA variation and a dendrogram constructed from Nei's genetic distances at isozyme loci both indicated the independent origin of the two selfing taxa, M. micranthus and M. laciniatus, from different ancestral M. guttatus populations. Phenotypic selection analysis demonstrated that both direct and indirect directional selection intensities were variable between populations but could be high. Decreased stigma-anther separation was favored in the one population that was likely pollinator-limited. Our results indicated that natural selection was strong enough to cause the repeated evolution of selfing in Mimulus and that the selective agent may be inadequate pollinator service.},

	Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, an area almost the size , of Japan, has a new network of no-take areas that significantly improves the protection of biodiversity. The new marine park zoning implements, in a quantitative manner, many of the theoretical design principles discussed in the literature. For example, the new network of no-take areas has at least 20% protection per "bioregion," minimum levels of protection for all known habitats and special or unique features, and minimum sizes for no-take areas of at least 10 or 20 kat across at the smallest diameter Overall, more than 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is now in no-take areas (previously 4.5%). The steps taken leading to this outcome were to clarify to the interested public why the existing level of protection wets inadequate; detail the conservation objectives of establishing new no-take areas; work with relevant and independent experts to define, and contribute to, the best scientific process to deliver on the objectives; describe the biodiversity (e.g., map bioregions); define operational principles needed to achieve the objectives; invite community input on all of The above; gather and layer the data gathered in round-table discussions; report the degree of achievement of principles for various options of no-take areas; and determine how to address negative impacts. Some of the key success factors in this case have global relevance and include focusing initial communication on the problem to be addressed; applying the precautionary principle; using independent experts; facilitating input to decision making; conducting extensive and participatory consultation; having an existing marine park that encompassed much of the ecosystem; having legislative power under federal law; developing high-level support; ensuring agency Priority and ownership; and being able to address the issue of displaced fishers.},

	Abstract = {Rising temperatures are predicted to cause temperate tree species to expand north into currently boreal dominated forests. Other factors, such as overabundant deer, may hinder temperate expansion. We examined how interactions among temperature, browse pressure, light availability, and initial size impact height and radial growth of naturally regenerated, competing temperate and boreal saplings across their overlapping range limits in central North America. In 9 of 10 growth model comparisons, the inclusion of mean summer temperature and browse damage as explanatory variables strongly improved model performance over the base model with only initial size and light availability as parameters. Potential growth reductions due to browse damage and temperature limitation were similar in magnitude (up to similar to 50%). Temperate sapling growth increased and boreal growth decreased with temperature across a regional summer temperature gradient (2.3 degrees C), causing a rank reversal in growth rates, and suggesting that temperature is a key driver of sapling performance and range boundaries. However, under high browse pressure positive temperate responses to temperature were eliminated, essentially pushing the crossover point in growth between temperate and boreal species further south. These results highlight the importance of interactions among global change agents and potential impediments for tree species to track a rapidly changing climate.},

	Abstract = {Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species' biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world's birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608-851 bird (6-9%), 670-933 amphibian (11-15%), and 47-73 coral species (6-9%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower IPCC SRES emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and area-specific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.},

	Abstract = {As cities expand worldwide, understanding how species adapt to novel urban habitats will become increasingly important to conservation. The adrenocortical stress response enables vertebrates to cope with novel environmental challenges to homeostasis. We examined total and estimates of free baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) concentrations and CORT binding globulin (CBG) levels in five passerine species within and around Phoenix, Arizona. We tested whether baseline and stress-induced CORT patterns differed among species living at varying densities in Phoenix and tested the hypothesis that, for species capable of successfully colonizing cities, individuals living in urban areas have a decreased acute stress response compared to individuals living in native desert. Baseline total CORT levels were generally similar in urban and rural birds. Capture and handling stress typically produced greater total CORT responses in urban birds than in rural birds, although these responses differed as a function of the life history stage (non-breeding, breeding or molt). CBG binding capacity did not change with life history stage or locality. Estimated free CORT concentrations differed less between groups than total CORT concentrations. Urban birds showed less variability in stress responses across life history stages than rural birds. We propose that more predictable resources in the city than in rural areas may decrease the need to vary stress responsiveness across life history stages. The results highlight the species-specific effects of urbanization on stress physiology and the difficulty to predict how urbanization impacts organisms. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Climate plays an important role in determining the geographic ranges of species. With rapid climate change expected in the coming decades, ecologists have predicted that species ranges will shift large distances in elevation and latitude. However, most range shift assessments are based on coarse-scale climate models that ignore fine-scale heterogeneity and could fail to capture important range shift dynamics. Moreover, if climate varies dramatically over short distances, some populations of certain species may only need to migrate tens of meters between microhabitats to track their climate as opposed to hundreds of meters upward or hundreds of kilometers poleward. To address these issues, we measured climate variables that are likely important determinants of plant species distributions and abundances (snow disappearance date and soil temperature) at coarse and fine scales at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, USA. Coarse-scale differences across the landscape such as large changes in elevation had expected effects on climatic variables, with later snow disappearance dates and lower temperatures at higher elevations. However, locations separated by small distances (similar to 20 m), but differing by vegetation structure or topographic position, often experienced differences in snow disappearance date and soil temperature as great as locations separated by large distances (>1 km). Tree canopy gaps and topographic depressions experienced later snow disappearance dates than corresponding locations under intact canopy and on ridges. Additionally, locations under vegetation and on topographic ridges experienced lower maximum and higher minimum soil temperatures. The large differences in climate we observed over small distances will likely lead to complex range shift dynamics and could buffer species from the negative effects of climate change.},

	Abstract = {Old-growth forests typically have complex structures, including heterogeneous spatial arrangements as well as a diversity of individual structures. Two aspects of this spatial complexity are discussed and illustrated: (1) vertical distribution of foliage, often apparent as multiple layers; and (2) horizontal heterogeneity, often evident as canopy gaps and dense reproduction patches. Shifts in mortality processes from competitive-based mortality in young stands to agent-based mortality (i.e., insects, diseases, and wind) in older stands play an important part in the development of structural heterogeneity. Old temperate forests can be viewed as fine-scale structural mosaics in which all stand development processes are simultaneously present within the stand. An additional definition of forest stand that incorporates the entire structural mosaic of old-growth is needed.},

	Abstract = {Ongoing climate change has affected the ecological dynamics of many species and is expected to impose natural selection on ecologically important traits. Droughts and other anticipated changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective factors, especially in and regions. Here we demonstrate the evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought. Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestor x descendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestor x descendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations. A systematic effort to collect and store propagules from suitable species would provide biologists with materials to detect and elucidate the genetic basis of further evolutionary shifts driven by climate change.},

	Abstract = {The genetic basis of flowering time in F-2 progeny derived from a cross of Mimulus guttatus was studied using seven unlinked isozyme markers. Each marker represented a specific chromosomal segment; its cosegregation with flowering time was used to characterize genes affecting flowering time. Three of the seven chromosomal segments were found to show significant, partially dominant effects on the expression of flowering time. These effects were relatively small, with segments marked by Me, 6Pgd2, and Tpi individually explaining only 2.3, 2.5, and 9.2 percent of total phenotypic variance, respectively. No significant pairwise epistasis was observed between any marked chromosomal segments. The results of this study indicate that the quantitative variation of flowering time in M. guttatus has a partial genetic basis, likely to consist of multiple genes of relatively small, partially dominant effects, with the potential to respond to natural selection.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies show advancing onset of plant growing season in many regions for the last several decades. With the well-established dependence of plant phenology on temperature, these trends are interpreted as an indication of global warming. For several decades, however, other determinants of plant phenology, e.g. varieties and trends in managed systems, may have changed and confounded the phenological trends. In this study, we tested if long-term changes in phenology of apple (Malus pumila var. domestica) are attributable to long-term changes in temperature by comparing the phenological response to long-term trend in air temperature, which is of our interest, with that to year-to-year fluctuation in air temperature, which should represent the real effect of temperature on phenology. We collected records of air temperature and phenological events (budding and flowering) in apple from 1977 to 2004 at six locations in Japan. Linear trends in flowering showed advancing rate in the range from 0.21 to 0.35 day yr-1, statistically significant at three locations (P < 0.05). We also found a warming trend in mean air temperature throughout March and April, with which flowering was closely correlated, in the range from 0.047 to 0.077 degrees C yr-1, statistically significant at five locations (P < 0.05). We separated the temperature time-series into two components: a long-term trend and a year-to-year fluctuation, by fitting smoothing spline to the trend and taking the residuals as the anomaly. We then fit a multiple regression model of phenological response to air temperature with separate coefficients for long-term trend and anomaly. Flowering date responded to the long-term trend at -3.8 day degrees C-1 and to the anomaly at -4.6 day degrees C-1. The temperature coefficients were not statistically different from each other or among locations, suggesting that the advance of apple phenology has predominantly been caused by the temperature increase across the locations studied. The same result was also observed with budding.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies in plant populations have found that environmental heterogeneity and phenotypic selection vary at local spatial scales. In this study, I ask if there is evolutionary change in response to environmental heterogeneity and, if so, whether the response occurs for characters or character plasticities. I used vegetative clones of Mimulus guttatus to create replicate populations of 75 genotypes. These populations were planted into the natural habitat where they differed in mean growth, flowering phenology, and life span. This phenotypic variation was used to define selective environments. There was variation in fitness (flower production) among genotypes across all planting sites and in genotype response to the selective environment. Offspring from each site were grown in the greenhouse in two water treatments. Because each population initially had the same genetic composition, variation in the progeny between selective environments reveals either evolutionary change in response to environmental heterogeneity or environmental maternal effects. Plants from experimental sites that flowered earlier, had shorter life spans and were less productive, produced offspring that had more flowers, on average, and were less plastic in vegetative allocation than offspring of longer-lived plants from high-productivity areas. However, environmental maternal effects masked phenotypic differences in flower production. Therefore, although there was evidence of genetic differentiation in both life-history characters and their plasticities in response to small-scale environmental heterogeneity, environmental maternal effects may slow evolutionary change. Response to local-scale selective regimes suggests that environmental heterogeneity and local variation in phenotypic selection may act to maintain genetic variation.},

	Abstract = {Population genetics theory suggests that two species which are reproductively isolated only by postzygotic barriers cannot co-exist in sympatry since the rarer population will become extinct Mimulus nudatus and Mimulus guttatus are two closely related species that are isolated by a postygotic barrier operating at the seed provisioning stage. On several sites on the serpentine soils of Lake and Napa counties, California, M. nudatus and M. guttatus live in sympatry and flowering times of the species overlap, so the species are sometimes flowering next to each other. We investigated whether there was any reduction in fertility of M. nudatus and ill. guttatus caused by interspecific crosses when growing in sympatry. The pollinators of M. nudatus and M. guttatus were identified. Small swear bees, Dialictus sp., preferentially visited the smaller flowered M. nudatus species and honey bees, Apis mellifera, preferred the larger flowered M. guttatus. In spire of most pollinator visits being intra-specific, individuals of both bee species made transitions between the Mimulus species. This will result in greater pollen transfer from M. guttatus to M. nudatus than vice versa because firstly, M. guttatus produces more pollen and secondly, the sweat bees were too small to touch the stigma of a M. guttatus flower. This asymmetry in gene flow was detected by greater reduction in viable seed produced by ill nudatus plants when surrounded by M. guttatus plants than vice versa. Only when M. nudatus was the maternal parent could any hybrids be detected in field produced seed. To enable M. nudatus and M. guttatus to co-exist in sympatry, the two species may thus need to be sufficiently ecologically different. Such ecological differentiation was attributed to the greater drought tolerance of M. nudatus. In addition, greenhouse experiments suggested that M. nudatus may have evolved greater tolerance to calcium deficient soils. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.},

	Abstract = {Understanding of the determinants of species' geographic range limits remains poorly integrated. In part, this is because of the diversity of perspectives on the issue, and because empirical studies have lagged substantially behind developments in theory. Here, I provide a broad overview, drawing together many of the disparate threads, considering, in turn, how influences on the terms of a simple single-population equation can determine range limits. There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

We highlight several records from western North America and their relevance in reconstructing historical forest dynamics, fire-climate relationships, and feedbacks between vegetation and fire under climate change. Climatic effects on fire regimes are evident in many regions, but comparisons of paleo-fire records sometimes show a lack of synchrony, indicating that local factors substantially affect fire occurrence, even over long periods. Furthermore, the specific impacts of vegetation change on fire regimes vary among regions with different vegetation histories.

Methods:We compared four bioclimatic variables [actual evapotranspiration (AET), water deficit (DEF), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), and growing degree-days (GDD5)] with the distribution of T. heterophylla at a 2-km grid cell resolution. The distribution is based on a zonal ecosystem classification where T. heterophylla is the dominant late-successional species. For each bioclimatic variable and at each degree of latitude, we calculated the threshold that best defines the T. heterophylla distribution and assessed the extent to which T. heterophylla was segregated to one end of the bioclimatic gradient. We also fitted two forms of multivariate bioclimatic models to predict the T. heterophylla distribution: a simple threshold model and a complex Gaussian mixture model. Each model was trained separately on the coastal and interior distributions, and predicted areas outside of the T. heterophylla distribution (overprediction) were evaluated with respect to known outlier populations. Results: Actual evapotranspiration was the most accurate predictor across the T. heterophylla distribution; other variables were important only in certain areas. There was strong latitudinal variation in the thresholds of all variables except AET, and the interior distribution had wider bioclimatic thresholds than the coastal distribution. The coastal distribution was predicted accurately by both bioclimatic models; areas of overprediction rarely occurred > 10 km from the observed distribution and generally matched small outlier populations. In contrast, the interior distribution was poorly predicted by both models; areas of overprediction occurred up to 140 km from the observed distribution and did not match outlier populations. The greatest overprediction occurred in Idaho and Montana in areas supporting species that typically co-exist with T. heterophylla. Main conclusions: The high predictive capacity of AET is consistent with this species' physiological requirements for a mild and humid climate. Spatial variation of MTCO, GDD5 and DEF thresholds probably reflects both the correlation of these variables with AET and ecotypic variation. The level of overprediction in portions of the interior suggests that T. heterophylla has not completely expanded into its potential habitat. Tsuga heterophylla became common in the interior 2000-3500 years ago, compared with > 9000 years ago in the coastal region. The limited time for dispersal, coupled with frequent fires at the margins of the distribution and competition with disturbance-adapted species, may have retarded range expansion in the interior. This study demonstrates that bioclimatic modelling can help identify various climatic and non-climatic controls on species distributions.},

	Abstract = {The US. Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that recovery plans include specific criteria to determine when a species should be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. To meet this mandate, we developed a new approach to determining classification criteria for long-lived vertebrates The key idea is that endangerment depends on two critical aspects of a population: population size and trends in population size due to intrinsic variability in population growth rates. The way to combine these features is to identify a population size and range of population growth rates (where lambda denotes the annual multiplicative rate of change of a population) above which there is a negligible probability of extinction. To do so, (1) information on the current population size and its variance is specified; (2) available information on vital rates or changes in abundance over time is used to generate a probability distribution for the population's lambda; (3) the lower fifth percentile value for lambda (denoted as lambda((0.05)))is obtained from the frequency distribution of lambda s and (4) if lambda((0.05)) is <1.0, a backwards population trajectory starting at 500 individuals for a period of 10 years is performed and the resulting population size is designated as the threshold for listing a species as endangered, or if lambda((0.05)) is greater than or equal to 1.0, the threshold for endangerment is set at 500 animals. A similar approach can be used to determine the threshold for listing a species as threatened under the ESA. We applied this approach to North Pacific humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used Monte Carlo simulations to produce a frequency distribution of lambda s for the whales under three different scenarios. Using lambda((0.05)) it was determined that the best estimates of current abundance for the central population of North Pacific humpback whales were larger than the estimated threshold for endangered status but less than the estimated threshold for threatened status if accepted by the responsible management agency this analysis would be consistent with a recommendation to downlist the central stock of humpback whales to a status of threatened, whereas the status of eastern and western stocks would remain endangered.},

	Abstract = {Many scientists lament the absence of data for endangered species and argue that mno-e funds should be spent acquiring basic information about population trends Using 19 years of abundance estimates for the eastern North Pacific gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we sampled subsets of the original survey data to identify the number of years of data required to remove the population from the U;S. Endangered Species Act's (ESA) list of endangered and threatened wildlife. I;or any given duration of monitoring, we selected all possible combinations of consecutive counts. To incorporate variability in growth rates, we extracted a maximum likelihood estimator of growth rate and confidence interval about that growth rate on the assumption that the population changes can be approximated by a simple diffusion process with drift. We then applied a new approach to determine ESA status for each subset of survey data and found that a quantitative decision to delist is unambiguously supported by 11 years of data but is precariously uncertain with fewer than 10 years of data. The data needed to produce an unequivocal decision to delist gray whales cost the National Marine Fisheries Service an estimated U.S. $660,000 a surprisingly modest expense given the fact that delisting can greatly simplify regulatory constraints This example highlights the value of population monitoring in administering the ESA and provides a compelling example of the utility of such information in identifying both imperiled and recovered species. The economic value of such data is that they provide the foundation for delisting, which could ultimately save much more money than the collection of the data would ever cost.},

A(sat) in current-year spruce remained unchanged in response to all treatments, but was over four-times higher than fir in control plots. These results indicated substantial low-temperature photoinhibition, and were supported by similar A(sat) trends in natural seedlings, Increased needle inclination and clustering in more exposed microsites for both species implicates the possible role of structural adaptations for decreased sky exposure and warmer leaf temperatures at night.},

	Abstract = {The importance of seedling establishment to the position of alpine-treeline is recognized, yet little is known about factors affecting the survival of seedlings of treeline conifers during their initial years of growth and establishment. This establishment period may have the greatest mortality of all life stages until death of mature trees by disease or fire. Spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution and survival of seedlings of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa were evaluated over four years in an alpine-treeline ecotone of the Snowy Range, Wyoming, USA. Seedlings and saplings of both species occurred most frequently near islands of adult trees. For P. englemannii, this appeared partly due to decreased survivorship of young seedlings (< 5 cm height) with greater distance away from tree islands. Survival of emergents of P. engelmannii was 28% greater on the north compared to south sides of tree islands, 48% lower on south-facing slopes compared to other aspects, and 70% greater with overhead cover such as tree branches. Survival of emergents was greater in microsites with grass cover (90% survival) compared to without ground cover (44% survival), but lowest in microsites surrounded, but not covered, by grass (19%). From 1994-1999, natural seedling emergence and survival was highest in 1995 (80% survival of 221 P. engelmannii, and 100% of seven A. lasiocarpa, in a sample area of 432 m 2), when the smallest mean difference in daily maximum and minimum temperatures occurred, and lowest in 1994 (30% of seven P. engelmannii), when above-average temperatures were accompanied by low rainfall and clear skies. The growth seasons of 1994 and 1995 had among the lowest and highest precipitation of the previous 30-year period, respectively. In an artificial seeding experiment, less than 20% of seedlings of both species survived their first complete year of growth. In the autumn of the second year, almost 25% additional mortality was observed in the remaining experimental seedlings when they were exposed to clear, cold skies without the normal protection of snowcover. Both spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival suggest that exposure to high sunlight may exacerbate low-temperature and water stress in young conifer seedlings, inhibiting their establishment in this alpine treeline.},

	Abstract = {Synopsis In 1967 Daniel Janzen published an influential paper titled "Why Mountain Passes Are Higher in the Tropics." Janzen derived a simple climatic-physiological model predicting that tropical mountain passes would be more effective barriers to organismal dispersal than would temperate-zone passes of equivalent altitude. This prediction derived from a recognition that the annual variation in ambient temperature at any site is relatively low in the tropics. Such low variation within sites not only reduces the seasonal overlap in thermal regimes between low- and high-altitude sites, but should also select for organisms with narrow physiological tolerances to temperature. As a result, Janzen predicted that tropical lowland organisms are more likely to encounter a Mountain pass as a physiological barrier to dispersal (hence "higher"), which should in turn favor smaller distributions and an increase in species turnover along altitudinal gradients. This synthetic hypothesis has long been at the center of discussions of latitudinal patterns of physiological adaptation and of species diversity. Here we review some of the key assumptions and predictions of Janzen's hypothesis. We find general support for many assumptions and predictions, but call attention to several issues that somewhat ameliorate the generality of Janzen's classic hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Rapid climate change is likely to impose strong selection pressures on traits important for fitness, and therefore, microevolution in response to climate-mediated selection is potentially an important mechanism mitigating negative consequences of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often - if not typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce.},

	Abstract = {Shaded coffee plantations have been heralded for their conservation value to avifauna. Most studies emphasize benefits to Neotropical migrants. Less is known about how resident species use plantations. It has been hypothesized that in Puerto Rico shaded coffee plantations served as a refuge for resident forest avifauna during periods of widespread deforestation, lowering extinction rates. Implicit in this hypothesis is that shaded coffee plantations harbor breeding populations. Accordingly, we report on reproductive activity and productivity of resident avifauna in plantations and compared them with similar data from secondary forests in Puerto Rico from 1997 to 1999. We found 253 nests in coffee plantations and 97 in secondary forests. Some of the most common nesting species were the endemics Todus mexicanus (53), Chlorostilbon maugaeus (27), Melanerpes portoricensis (16), and Anthracothorax viridis (12). Predation and nest abandonment each accounted for 38% of nest failures. The likelihood of nest success did not differ between secondary forest and coffee plantations for vireos, tanagers and hummingbirds. Similarly, the average number of young per nest attempt did not differ between habitat types for four species with sufficient data. Although the fate of fledglings (e.g., dispersal, survival) was not assessed, our findings lend support to the refugia hypothesis because the composition of resident species found nesting in shaded coffee plantations and secondary forests and their productivity were similar. The production capacity of shaded coffee plantations, however, is dependent on nesting substrates provided by the shade vegetation layer, not the understory or coffee trees.},

The study was carried out in the city of Brussels where all vascular plant species were recorded in 189 grid cells of 1 km(2) each. The effect of urban land use type on species composition was investigated using first Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Densely built-up area was the most powerful predictor for species composition, followed by industrial built-up areas, half open or open built-up areas with plantations, and open built-up areas with much natural vegetation in the surroundings. Indicator species were found for each type of built-up area and a response curve to the amount of built land was produced using Generalised Additive Modelling. Various types of built-up areas had different effects on environmental conditions as inferred by Ellenberg's indicator values, as well as on the species richness, species rarity, number of exotic species and proportion of extinction-prone species. It is concluded that future ecological studies should not treat urban areas as homogeneous areas by combining all anthropogenic factors into one aggregated variable. Instead, the urban matrix should be categorised in subsystems as it is multidimensional and highly variable across space.},

	Abstract = {Biological invasions severely impact native plant communities, causing dramatic shifts in species composition and the restriction of native species to spatially isolated refuges. Competition from resident species and the interaction between resource limitation and competition have been overlooked as mechanisms of community resistance in refugia habitats. We examined the importance of these factors in determining the resistance of California serpentine plant communities to invasion by three common European grasses, Avena barbata, Bromus diandrus, and Hordeum murinum. We added seeds of each of these grasses to plots subjected to six levels of resource addition (N, P, Ca, H2O, all resources together, and a no-addition control) and two levels of competition (with resident community present or removed). Resource limitation and competition had strong effects on the biomass and reproduction of the three invaders. The addition of all resources together combined with the removal of the resident community yielded individual plants that were fourfold to 20-fold larger and sixfold to 20-fold more fecund than plants from control plots. Competitor removal alone yielded invaders that were twofold to sevenfold larger and twofold to ninefold more fecund. N addition alone or in combination with other resources led to a twofold to ninefold increase in the biomass and fecundity of the invaders. No other resource alone significantly affected native or invader performance, suggesting that N was the key limiting resource during our experiment. We found a significant interaction between abiotic and biotic resistance for Bromus, which experienced increased competitive suppression in fertilized plots. The threefold increase in resident biomass with N addition was likely responsible for this result. Our results confirm that serpentine plant communities are severely N limited, which, in combination with competition from resident species, promotes the resistance of these systems to invasions. Our work suggests that better understanding the relative sensitivities of invaders and residents to the physical environment is critical to predicting how abiotic and biotic factors interact to determine community resistance.},

We consider a subset of these factors by using spatial models of competition, hybridization, and local adaptation to examine the effects of partial dispersal barriers on the locations of borders between similar species. Prompted by results from population genetic models and biogeographic observations, we investigate the conditions under which species' borders are attracted to regions of reduced dispersal. For borders maintained by competition or hybridization, we find that dispersal barriers can attract borders whose positions would otherwise be either neutrally stable or moving across space. Borders affected strongly by local adaptation and gene flow, however, are repelled from dispersal barriers. These models illustrate how particular biotic and abiotic factors may combine to limit species' ranges, and they help to elucidate mechanisms by which range limits of many species may coincide.},

	Abstract = {Mixed mating, in which hermaphrodite plant species reproduce by both self- and cross-fertilization, presents a challenging problem for evolutionary biologists. Theory suggests that inbreeding depression, the main selective factor opposing the evolution of selfing, can be purged with self-fertilization, a process that is expected to yield pure strategies of either outcrossing or selfing. Here we present updated evidence suggesting that mixed mating systems are frequent in seed plants. We outline the floral and pollination mechanisms that can lead to intermediate outcrossing, review the theoretical models that address the stability of intermediate outcrossing, and examine relevant empirical evidence. A comparative analysis of estimated inbreeding coefficients and outcrossing rates suggests that mixed mating often evolves despite strong inbreeding depression. The adaptive significance of mixed mating has yet to be fully explained for any species. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that future progress will come from a better integration of studies of floral mechanisms, genetics, and ecology, and recognition of how selective pressures vary in space and time.},

	Abstract = {Reduced recruitment of blue oak (Quercus douglasii) seedlings in California grasslands and woodlands may result from shifts in seasonal soil water availability coincident with replacement of the native perennial herbaceous community by Mediterranean annuals. We used a combination of container and field experiments to examine the interrelationships between soil water potential, herbaceous neighborhood composition, and blue oak seedling shoot emergence and growth. Neighborhoods of exotic annuals depleted soil moisture more rapidly than neighborhoods of a perennial grass or "no-neighbor" controls. Although effects of neighborhood composition on oak seedling root elongation were not statistically significant, seedling shoot emergence was significantly inhibited in the annual neighborhoods where soil water was rapidly depleted. Seedling water status directly reflected soil water potential, which also determined the extent and duration of oak seedling growth during the first year. End-of-season seedling height significantly influenced survival and growth in subsequent years. While growth and survival of blue oak seedlings may be initially constrained by competition with herbaceous species, subsequent competition with adult blue oak trees may further contribute to reduced sapling recruitment.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of presence-absence matrices with "null model" randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Conner and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do nut co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not. greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of 96 published presence-absence matrices and used a realistic "null model" to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamond's model: there were fewer species combinations, more checkerboard species pairs, and less co-occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co-occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap between experimental and correlative studies in community ecology.},

	Abstract = {Globally, The number of recreational fishers is sizeable and increasing in many countries. Associated with this trend is the potential for negative impacts on fish stocks through exploitation or management measures such as stocking and introduction of non-native fishes. Nevertheless, recreational fishers call be instrumental in successful fisheries conservation through active involvement in, or initiation of, conservation projects to reduce both direct and external stressors contributing to fishery declines. Understanding fishers' concerns for sustained access to the resource and developing methods for their meaningful participation can have positive impacts on conservation efforts. We examined a suite of case studies that demonstrate successful involvement of recreational fishers in conservation and management activities that span developed and developing countries, temperate and tropical regions, marine and freshwater systems, and open- and closed access fisheries. To illustrate potential benefits and challenges of involving recreational fishers in fisheries management and conservation, we examined the socioeconomic and ecological contexts of each case study. We devised a conceptual framework for the engagement of recreational fishers that targets particular types of involvement (enforcement, advocacy, conservation, management design [type and location], research, and monitoring) on the basis of degree of stakeholder stewardship, scale of the fishery, and source of impacts (Internal or external). These activities can be enhanced by incorporating local knowledge and traditions, taking advantage of leadership and regional networks, and creating collaborations among various stakeholder groups, scientists, and agencies to maximize the probability of recreational fisher involvement and project success.},

Riviere, Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel ex Lehaie, Phyllostachys bambusoides Siebold et Zucc., and Bambusa ventricosa McClure) growing at the Botanical Garden of Rome were studied. Among the considered species, P. pubescens had the highest mean culm height (14.3 +/- 0.6 m) and diameter (10.7 +/- 1.5 cm), while B. ventricosa had the lowest mean culm height (6.0 +/- 0.2 m) and internodes number (35 +/- 1). The highest net photosynthetic rates (NP) of the considered species were measured in early autumn, while the lowest ones in spring (30% of the maximum in the genus Phyllostachys), in the period of vegetative activity, and in winter (10% of the maximum in B. ventricosa). The correlation between NP and leaf temperature (LT) indicated that the favourable temperature enabling 50-100% of NP was in the range 2.2-32.1 and 16.2-36.3 degrees C for the genus Phyllostachys and B. ventricosa, respectively. According to their origin, the species of the genus Phyllostachys, originating in a temperate climate had a higher sensibility to high air temperatures than B. ventricosa, originating in a tropical and subtropical climate, and having a lower sensibility to low air temperatures. Owing to the great potential for biomass production bamboos could be a significant net sink for CO2 carbon sequestration; nevertheless, by the highest whole culm photosynthetic rate (WNP = 272 +/- 7.2 mu mol CO2 s(-1)), calculated by the total leaf surface area per culm. (28.6 +/- 1.1 m(2)) and the mean maximum yearly assimilation rate (9.5 +/- 4.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), P. pubescens contributed in major role to carbon sequestration (14 +/- 0.6 kg CO2 year(-1) per culm) compared with the other considered species (on the average 3.0 +/- 1.6 kg CO2 year(-1), mean value).

	Abstract = {Tree seedling establishment and growth were studied in experimental canopy gaps to assess the effect of heterogeneity of regeneration microsites within and among gaps in mature conifer forests. Seedlings were studied for two years in closed-canopy areas and in recently created gaps ranging in size from 40 to 2000 m(2) in four stands of mature (90-140 yr) and old-growth (>400 yr) Douglas-fir forest in the western Cascade Range of central Oregon and southern Washington, USA. We examined the relative importance of substrate type, shade from logs and shade cloth, density of understory vegetation, gap size, and forest age on the success of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Seedlings originating from seed sown on experimental microsites were compared with seedlings regenerating naturally on a range of microsites.

Seedling establishment was greater on decayed wood than on forest floor or mineral soil in closed-canopy areas, particularly for Tsuga. Differences in establishment among substrates declined with increasing gap size, although establishment on the forest floor tended to be low in portions of large gaps exposed to direct solar radiation. In exposed areas, shade from woody debris and shade cloth facilitated establishment for all species, while shade from understory vegetation aided the establishment of Pseudotsuga but not that of Tsuga. Establishment in shaded portions of gaps declined with vegetation and shade-cloth cover. Seedling size increased with gap size, decreased with level of shade, and tended to be greatest on forest floor and lowest on decayed wood.

Establishment and growth of the different species was related to differences in seed mass and tolerance of environmental extremes. Heterogeneity at the seedling scale (<10 cm) often overrode larger-scale environmental gradients (>2 m) associated with gap size and within-gap position. Thus the gap partitioning hypothesis, which emphasizes gap size and within-gap position, may be too simple to account for the role of microsite heterogeneity and species' regeneration traits on the development of mature forests.},

	Abstract = {Background: The Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery (ECOTF) for penaeid shrimp fishes within Australia's Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). The past decade has seen the implementation of conservation and fisheries management strategies to reduce the impact of the ECOTF on the seabed and improve biodiversity conservation. New information from electronic vessel location monitoring systems (VMS) provides an opportunity to review the interactions between the ECOTF and spatial closures for biodiversity conservation. Methodology and Results: We used fishing metrics and spatial information on the distribution of closures and modelled VMS data in a geographical information system (GIS) to assess change in effort of the trawl fishery from 2001-2009 and to quantify the exposure of 70 reef, non-reef and deep water bioregions to trawl fishing. The number of trawlers and the number of days fished almost halved between 2001 and 2009 and new spatial closures introduced in 2004 reduced the area zoned available for trawl fishing by 33%. However, we found that there was only a relatively minor change in the spatial footprint of the fishery as a result of new spatial closures. Non-reef bioregions benefited the most from new spatial closures followed by deep and reef bioregions. Conclusions/Significance: Although the catch of non target species remains an issue of concern for fisheries management, the small spatial footprint of the ECOTF relative to the size of the GBRWHA means that the impact on benthic habitats is likely to be negligible. The decline in effort as a result of fishing industry structural adjustment, increasing variable costs and business decisions of fishers is likely to continue a trend to fish only in the most productive areas. This will provide protection for most benthic habitats without any further legislative or management intervention.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies using capture-recapture modelling in terrestrial orchids have shown relationships among survival, life-state, climate and dormancy, but to date, there has been no rigorous study of the effects of size on demographic rates. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models to investigate the relationships between survival, ramet size, lifestate, and propensity for extended dormancy of Cleistes bifaria in two populations in Florida and West Virginia. Using estimated leaf area as a measure of ramet size, we investigated relative fit to the data of models in which ramets were classified by life-state alone (dormant, vegetative, and flowering), size alone (dormant, small, and large), or by a combination of size and state (dormant, small vegetative, large vegetative, small flowering, and large flowering ramets). This scheme allowed us to compare the effects of a size versus state classification on survival and transition probabilities, including the propensity for dormancy For survival rates, the size-classified model was preferable in terms of parsimony (AIC) to models classified either by state or by a combination of size and state. In C. bifaria, annual survival rate for large ramets was close to 1.0 and for small and dormant ramets, 0.91 and 0.76, respectively This highlights the importance of protecting large plants. In contrast, a model combining life-state with ramet size was most parsimonious for explaining variation in transition rates. As the 'size + state' classification is convenient, holds more information, and seems more closely tied to fitness than classification by either size or life-state alone, it may be particularly useful in planning and assessing conservation management of orchids.

	Abstract = {During the growing season, some individuals in perennial plant populations may remain alive belowground while others emerge. This phenomenon, known as prolonged dormancy, seems maladaptive, because prolonged dormancy delays growth and reproduction. However, prolonged dormancy may offer the benefit of safety while belowground, leading to the hypothesis that prolonged dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy. We evaluated this hypothesis using a 25-year demographic study of Astragalus scaphoides, an iteroparous perennial plant. First, we determined the relationship between prolonged dormancy and fitness using data from individuals in our population. This analysis showed that prolonged dormancy decreased arithmetic mean fitness and reduced variance in fitness. Geometric mean fitness was maximized at intermediate levels of prolonged dormancy. Empirical patterns of lifetime reproductive success confirm this relationship. We also compared fitness of plants in our population to hypothetical plants without prolonged dormancy, which generally revealed benefits of prolonged dormancy, even if plants could forgo prolonged dormancy without costs to other vital rates. Therefore, prolonged dormancy may indeed function as a bet-hedging strategy, but the benefits of remaining belowground outweigh the costs only for a subset of individuals. Bet hedging has been demonstrated in plants with simple life histories, such as annuals and monocarpic perennials; we present evidence that bet hedging may be important for plants with more complex life histories.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists often consider how environmental factors limit a species' geographic range. However, recent models suggest that geographic distribution also may be determined by a species' ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions. In this study, we empirically tested whether further evolution would be necessary for northern expansion of the weedy annual cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) in its native North American range. We transplanted seedlings beyond the northern border and photoperiodically manipulated reproductive timing, a trait important for adaptation to shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes within the range, to determine whether further evolution of this trait would result in a phenotype viable beyond the range. Earlier reproductive induction enabled plants to produce mature seeds beyond the range and to achieve a reproductive output similar to those grown within the range. Therefore, evolution of earlier reproduction in marginal populations would be necessary for northward range expansion. This study is the first to empirically show that evolution in an ecologically important trait would enable a species to survive and reproduce beyond its current range. These results suggest that relatively few traits may limit a species' range and that identifying evolutionary constraints on such traits could be important for predicting geographic distribution.},

However, little is known about which traits contribute to adaptation or whether their further evolution would facilitate range expansion. In this study, we assessed the adaptive value of stress avoidance traits in the common annual Cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) by performing a reciprocal transplant across a broad latitudinal gradient extending to the species' northern border. Populations were locally adapted and stress avoidance traits accounted for most fitness differences between populations. At the northern border where growing seasons are cooler and shorter, native populations had evolved to reproduce earlier than native populations in the lower latitude gardens. This clinal pattern in reproductive timing corresponded to a shift in selection from favouring later to earlier reproduction. Thus, earlier reproduction is an important adaptation to northern latitudes and constraint on the further evolution of this trait in marginal populations could potentially limit distribution.},

	Abstract = {The importance of the spatial arrangement of populations for long-term persistence has been debated. Plant species will be influenced mostly by the responses of their pollinators and herbivores to changes in population isolation, making it hard to predict how habitat fragmentation may affect a plant species. I have used a common annual to examine how population isolation may affect reproductive success and ultimately population growth and persistence. Clarkia concinna concinna exhibits considerable pollen limitation when small populations are isolated, although it also endures less herbivory. For this plant, isolation appears mostly to depress population growth and therefore to enhance risks of extinction. Experimental investigations on common species such as C. concinna concinna can be used to better diagnose threats to endangered taxa, and to design appropriate restoration activities.

	Abstract = {Allee effects may be experienced by plants when populations are too small or isolated to receive sufficient pollinator services to replace themselves. This article reports experimental data from an annual herb, Clarkia concinna, documenting that small patches suffered reproductive failure due to lack of effective pollination when critical thresholds of isolation were exceeded. In contrast, sufficiently large patches attracted pollinators regardless of their degree of isolation. These data accord with data on patch extinctions showing that small and isolated patches have a higher extinction rate than do large patches and with observations showing chronically low reproductive success in such patches prior to extinction. While not conclusively demonstrating that Allee effects cause extinction in small and isolated patches, the data are suggestive. Although threshold effects have been postulated in several mathematical models of population viability, this is the first report of data from natural populations that display the occurrence of such thresholds. These results have implications for the management of endangered plants, which often are restricted to isolated, small populations, as well as suggesting a potential limit to spatial spread in plant populations dependent on animal vectors for reproduction.},

@article{RefWorks:420,
	Abstract = {Fragmented populations may face high risk of extinction due to the deleterious consequences of increased inbreeding or of genetic drift in small and isolated populations. Theories on the mechanisms of inbreeding depression predict that the severity of inbreeding depression can eventually decrease in populations that persistently inbreed, and hence populations that are isolated through habitat fragmentation might experience a decrease in inbreeding depression over time. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using the patchily distributed, outcrossing annual plant, Clarkia concinna concinna (Onagraceae), which naturally experiences many fragmentation effects. We collected seeds from isolated and central subpopulations and created artificially inbred and outcrossed lines. Progeny from these crosses were planted into the field and greenhouse and assayed for fitness traits over the course of a growing season. Overall, inbreeding depression was substantial, ranging as high as 0.76 (for cumulative fitness in the field), and significant for plant height, fecundity, and above-ground biomass in all experiments. No inbreeding depression was detected for germination or survival rates in the greenhouse experiments, but in the field, survival was significantly depressed for inbred progeny. There was no evidence to support our hypothesis that increased inbreeding in isolated populations would lead to the purging of deleterious alleles and a decrease in the severity inbreeding depression. The most likely hypothesis to explain our results is that purging is not occurring more strongly in the isolated populations due to details of a number of genetic factors (e.g., selection against deleterious alleles is inconsistent or insufficient, or drift has caused fixation of deleterious alleles in these populations). This study supports the view that even when inbreeding depression is predicted to be less problematic, it may still be an important force influencing the fitness of populations.},

	Abstract = {Biofuels are a newpriority in efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; nevertheless, the rapid increase in production of biofuel feedstock may threaten biodiversity. There are general principles that should be used in developing guidelines for certifying biodiversity friendly biofuels. First, biofuel feedstocks should be grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity friendly agricultural practices. The sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the fuel-production life cycle. Second, the ecological footprint of a biofuel, in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities of the feedstock, should be minimized. The best alternatives appear to be fuels of the future, especially fuels derived from microalgae. Third, biofuels that can sequester carbon or that have a negative or zero carbon balance when viewed over the entire production life cycle should be given high priority. Corn-based ethanol is the worst among the alternatives that are available at present, although this is the biofuel that is most advanced for commercial production in the United States. We urge aggressive pursuit of alternatives to corn as a biofuel feedstock. Conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen efforts to develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research on biodiversity friendly biofuel production practices and by helping define biodiversity-friendly biofuel certification standards.},

	Abstract = {Nutrient enrichment is a threat to botanical diversity in Europe, and its assessment is part of biodiversity monitoring schemes. In Switzerland, this is done by calculating the average nutrient (N) indicator value of the vegetation based on a country-wide systematic vegetation survey. However, it is questionable whether N values indicate eutrophication and resulting species loss equally well across an entire country, which includes wide topographic gradients and distinct biogeographic regions. Here we analyze vascular plant species lists from 415 grassland plots (10 m(2)) between 365 and 2770 m a.s.l. throughout Switzerland to investigate how the relationship between N value and species richness differs with altitude and among regions. The N value strongly decreased with altitude (piecewise regression: r(2) = 0.77), particularly between 800 and 2000 m a.s.l., where this decrease was related to a decreasing proportion of fertilized grasslands. In the alpine belt, lower N values were associated with a greater frequency of acidic soils and a restricted species pool. Vascular plant species richness was maximal at intermediate altitude (piecewise regression: r(2) = 0.33) and intermediate N value (polynomial regression: r(2) = 0.46). When analyzed separately by altitudinal belt, the relationship between species richness and N value was negative in the lowlands and montane belt but unimodal in the subalpine belt. In the alpine belt, soil pH (R indicator values) explained most of the variation in species richness. Two indices of between-plot diversity (floristic dissimilarity and the contribution of individual plots to total species richness) were negatively related to N values from the lowlands to the subalpine belt but not in the alpine belt. All relationships differed little among the biogeographic regions of Switzerland, but they might be modified by changes in management and by the expansion of common lowland species into mountain grasslands.

	Abstract = {Because data on rare species usually are sparse, it is important to have efficient ways to sample additional data. Traditional sampling approaches are of limited value for rare species because a very large proportion of randomly chosen sampling sites are unlikely to shelter the species. For these species, spatial predictions from niche-based distribution models can be used to stratify the sampling and increase sampling efficiency. New data sampled are then used to improve the initial model. Applying this approach repeatedly is an adaptive process that may allow increasing the number of new occurrences found. We illustrate the approach with a case study of a rare and endangered plant species in Switzerland and a simulation experiment. Our field survey confirmed that the method helps in the discovery of new populations of the target species in remote areas where the predicted habitat suitability is high. In our simulations the model-based approach provided a significant improvement (by a factor of 1.8 to 4 times, depending on the measure) over simple random sampling. In terms of cost this approach may save up to 70% of the time spent in the field. D},

	Abstract = {The timing of when to initiate reproduction is an important transition in any organism's life cycle. There is much variation in flowering time among populations, but we do not know to what degree this variation contributes to local adaptation. Here we use a reciprocal transplant experiment to examine the presence of divergent natural selection for flowering time and local adaptation between two distinct populations of Mimulus guttatus. We plant both parents and hybrids (to tease apart differences in suites of associated parental traits) between these two populations into each of the two native environments and measure floral, vegetative, life-history, and fitness characters to assess which traits are under selection at each site. Analysis of fitness components indicates that each of these plant populations is locally adapted. We obtain striking evidence for divergent natural selection on date of first flower production at these two sites. Early flowering is favored at the montane site, which is inhabited by annual plants and characterized by dry soils in midsummer, whereas intermediate (though later) flowering dates are selectively favored at the temperate coastal site, which is inhabited by perennial plants and is almost continually moist. Divergent selection on flowering time contributes to local adaptation between these two populations of M. guttatus, suggesting that genetic differentiation in the timing of reproduction may also serve as a partial reproductive isolating barrier to gene flow among populations.},

	Abstract = {Bioclimatic hypotheses are used to explain how climate regulates the occurrence of species. A derivative of these hypotheses is that plants moved between corresponding bioclimatic areas should thrive, whereas plants moved to a different zone should languish. This principle is routinely applied in forestry and horticulture but actual tests of the hypotheses seem scanty. We carried out a test on the Finnish system of bioclimatic vegetation zoning using the plant collection of Helsinki University Botanic Garden in Kumpula, which is situated at the northern limit of the hemiboreal zone. We aimed to test how the plants' survival depends on their provenance with the expectation that plants from the hemiboreal or southern boreal zones should do best in Kumpula. Probability of survival was estimated using collection database information of 379 plant accessions of known wild origin, and logit models. Different growth forms were analysed separately. In most analyses accessions of temperate and hemiarctic origin showed lower survival probability than those originating from any of the boreal subzones, which among them exhibited rather evenly high probabilities. Trees were an exception showing an almost steadily increasing survival probability from temperate to northern boreal origin. In all, the results gave some support to the tested hypothesis, but the various factors that could not be controlled for produced results that were difficult to interpret. We conclude that botanic gardens should pay due attention to information management and curational practices to ensure widest possible applicability of their plant collections.},

The era of big data need not be propelled only by "big science" - the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort - a large volume of distributed, high-value information - but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power.

	Abstract = {According to a hypothesis presented in the mid-1980s, climate warming will, paradoxically, increase the risk of frost damage to trees in the boreal and temperate zones. Dehardening and even growth onset may occur in trees during mild spells in winter and early spring, resulting in damage during subsequent periods of frost. In the present study, ecophysiological traits critical to the occurrence of frost damage in trees in the boreal zone were identified. Diagnostic computer simulations were performed to examine why one simulation model of frost hardiness in an earlier study predicted heavy frost damage as a consequence of climate warming, whereas another closely related model did not. The modeling comparison revealed that the response of ontogenetic development to air temperature during quiescence is a critical factor determining the risk of frost damage. As the response can be readily determined in growth-chamber experiments, the findings of the present study can be used to guide experimental work on the environmental regulation of the annual cycle of frost hardiness in trees.},

	Abstract = {Circumstantial evidence suggests that plants that have evolved metal tolerance are at a disadvantage on normal soil, i.e. there is a cost of tolerance. One hypothesis for the cause of this cost is that individuals have a greater requirement for copper, and so suffer micronutrient deficiency on normal soils, as a result of a reduced uptake, distribution and/or utilization of copper. We provided highly and less copper-tolerant plants of Mimulus guttatus Fischer ex DC. (the common monkey flower) with sub-optimal copper, and demonstrated the importance of copper as an essential micronutrient during the reproductive phase, both in the production of viable pollen and in seed set. We also looked at the effect of sub-optimal copper supply on the growth of the microgametophyte, and the efficiency with which seed was set. No evidence was found that highly tolerant plants have an increased copper requirement during the reproductive phase. This is in agreement with earlier work on Mimulus guttatus, which investigated the copper requirement of highly tolerant plants during vegetative growth and found that any differences in copper requirement were small. The 'metal requirement hypothesis' is, therefore, not the sole explanation for the cost of copper tolerance in M. guttatus.},

	Abstract = {1. It is frequently asserted that the adaptation of metal tolerance involves a cost, i.e. tolerant individuals have a lowered fitness on uncontaminated soil. To date, however, evidence for a cost has been highly circumstantial. One well-known example of metal tolerance, copper tolerance in Mimulus guttatus is used in this paper to search for a cost. 2. The absence of highly tolerant plants in the field, despite the ability to select, rapidly and artificially, for extreme levels of tolerance, indicates that strong selection against extreme tolerance occurs in this species. 3. Negative genetic correlations between plants selected for increased degree of tolerance and other fitness traits were sought to test the trade-off hypothesis that energy/resources needed to manifest tolerance are diverted away from other essential traits. 4. The case for using replicated selection lines when using this methodology to demonstrate a cost is put forward. It is argued that replication is required to show unambiguously that any correlations found result from the pleiotropic effects of the gene(s) that govern the adaptation and not the consequence of linkage disequilibrium. 5. No clear evidence to support the trade-off hypothesis was found.},

This argument forms the basis of the metal requirement hypothesis put forward to explain the lower fitness of tolerant individuals on uncontaminated soil, the so called 'cost of tolerance'. In this paper, copper balance was investigated in Mimulus guttatus Fischer ex. DC (the yellow monkey flower) for plants with or without the major tolerance gene which confers primary tolerance, and plants with few or many modifier genes which control degree of tolerance. No conclusive evidence to support an increased copper requirement in plants with the major tolerance gene, and/or many modifier genes was shown. Any differences in copper requirement found during vegetative growth were small, and were deemed insufficient to explain the apparent cost of tolerance.},

	Abstract = {Aim Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or 'form') such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics. Location The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally. Methods In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general 'first-level' mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what 'second-level' mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours ('third-level' mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics. Results We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive. Main conclusions Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses.},

Currently, managers around the world focus on various timeframes from recent to historical, but without a definitive target, countless conservation problems arise. Managers need to determine what constitutes a native species, which species to reintroduce, whether selective breeding should be implemented to resurrect supposedly extinct organisms, targets on population levels, whether assisted migration should be employed when climate change alters the environmental envelope of a species surrounded by human-altered landscapes, and how to manage for stochasticity and evolutionary processes. Without having definitive goals to target, these issues are difficult/impossible to address. It is only by discussing these important issues that some consensus will be attained that allow us to stop responding to crises and start predicting the future of biodiversity and plan and respond accordingly.},

	Abstract = {Climate warming affects the phenology, local abundance and large-scale distribution of plants and pollinators. Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches.},

	Abstract = {Niche theory with hypotheses on shape and distribution of ecological response curves is used in the studies of resource sharing of competing plant species. Predictions based on theory should be applicable when, e.g., effects of competing species on the ecological tolerances are assessed or species' diversity along a resource gradient is evaluated. We studied the ecological response curves of competing plant species along a resource gradient in boreal forests. The study was based on nation-wide soil and vegetation data collected from 455 sample plots on boreal forests in Finland. Species response curves along a soil fertility gradient (in terms of C/N ratio) were estimated using generalized additive models. Distribution of species optima and the relationship of niche width and skewness to the location of the optimum were analyzed with new bootstrap tests. The developed tests can account for the effects of truncation observed in the response curves of several species and for the uneven distribution of observations on the gradient. The estimated response curves of the major field layer species of boreal forests were not evenly distributed along soil C/N gradient. The density of optima peaked with relatively high nitrogen availability. Species with optima at low nitrogen availability had relatively broad realized niches. Niche width was negatively correlated with the density of optima. Species optima were packed and niches were narrow at high resource levels. This result suggests that a greater number of more specialized species can occur and interspecific competition decreases niche widths at high resource levels. Species were packed in the gradient where the C/N ratio was lower than 25, i.e., in conditions where nitrification can take place. This indicates that the majority of the vascular plants of boreal forests are favoured by the availability of N03-. Those few species thriving at high C/N ratios have broader realized niches.

	Abstract = {The fossil record tells us that many species shifted their geographic distributions during historic climate changes, but this record does not portray the complete picture of future range change in response to climate change. In particular, it does not provide information on how species interactions will affect range shifts. Therefore, we also need modern research to generate understanding of range change. This paper focuses on the role that species interactions play in promoting or preventing geographic ranges shifts under current and future climate change, and we illustrate key points using empirical case studies from an integrated study system. Case studies can have limited generalizability, but they are critical to defining possible outcomes under climate change. Our case studies emphasize host limitation that could reduce range shifts and enemy release that could facilitate range expansion. We also need improvements in modeling that explicitly consider species interactions, and this modeling can be informed by empirical research. Finally, we discuss how species interactions have implications for range management by people.},

	Abstract = {Seed banking is assumed to be unimportant for temperate trees, because their seeds are short-lived in soils. However, even short-term seed banking could increase recruitment and affect population dynamics of seed-banking trees. To investigate this possibility, we examined early life-history stages of red maple (Acer rubrum L.), an abundant seed-banking tree in eastern forests. We found that seed banking benefits red maple by increasing germination when seedling survival is likely. Most red maple seeds germinate soon after spring dispersal, when seedling survival is high, or postpone germination to the following growing season, once seedling survival becomes less likely late in the summer. This occurs because seed dormancy increases during the growing season, matching a concurrent decrease in seedling survival. Our results and those of other studies suggest seed dormancy is increased by the same environmental factors (low light and low moisture) that also decrease seedling survival. We speculate that early life-history traits, including seed banking, may have contributed to this species' increased abundance in eastern deciduous forests in the last century.},

	Abstract = {Processes limiting recruitment of trees may have large impacts on forest dynamics. In this paper, we determined the effects of dispersal, shrubs (Rhododendron maximum), and density-dependent mortality on seed and seedling distributions of Southern Appalachian trees. We quantified the spatial distribution of seed rain, seed bank densities, first-year seedlings, and older than first-year seedlings in five vegetation plots. We fit models to these data assuming effects of limited dispersal, R. maximum (an understory shrub), and (or) density-dependent mortality (as well as a null model with none of these effects) and used best-fitting models to indicate which processes affected a particular species. We found that all factors examined limit species distributions, and thus, affect seedling dynamics. Seedling densities are higher near parent trees long after dispersal occurs. This pattern is less frequently observed for animal-dispersed species than for wind-dispersed species, presumably due to secondary dispersal of seeds by animals. Seedling densities of five species are decreased beneath R. maximum. Shade tolerance does not explain which species are affected, suggesting that factors other than low light are responsible for increased seedling mortality under this shrub. Our results suggest that density-dependent mortality affects four species, decreasing seedling densities close to parent trees. Dispersal, density-dependent mortality, and R. maximum all act in ways that may promote or limit diversity, illustrating that multiple factors are likely to control species diversity.},

If species experience greater mortality when abundant, then more rare species can persist(1,2,7-9). Agents of density-dependent mortality (such as host-specific predators, and pathogens) may be more prevalent or have stronger effects in tropical forests, because they are not limited by climatic factors(1-5). If so, decreasing density-dependent mortality with increasing latitude could partially explain the observed latitudinal gradient in tree diversity(4-6). This hypothesis has never been tested with latitudinal data. Here we show that several temperate tree species experience density-dependent mortality between seed dispersal and seedling establishment. The proportion of species affected is equivalent to that in tropical forests(6,10-16), failing to support the hypothesis that this mechanism is more prevalent at tropical latitudes. We further show that density-dependent mortality is misinterpreted in previous studies. Our results and evidence from other studies suggest that density-dependent mortality is important in many forests. Thus, unless the strength of density-dependent mortality varies with latitude, this mechanism is not likely to explain the high diversity of tropical forests.},

	Abstract = {Seed dormancy is assumed to be unimportant for population dynamics of temperate woody species, because seeds occur at low densities and are short lived in forest soils. However, low soil seed densities may result from low seed production, and even modest seed longevity can buffer against fluctuating seed production, potentially limiting density-dependent mortality and ensuring that seeds are available for germination when recruitment success is likely. To investigate whether seed banking affects woody seedling dynamics in the southern Appalachians, we monitored seed rain, seed bank, and seedling densities to (1) determine the prevalence of seed banking among southern Appalachian woody species, (2) quantify annual seed mortality rates for three seed-banking species using a Bayesian statistical approach, and (3) assess whether or not the ability to,seed bank affects recruitment rates. We found that the seeds of eight woody taxa (Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron talipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rubus spp., Sassafras albidum, and Vitis sp.) remain viable in the soil for more than one year. Seeds of six taxa (Amelanchier spp., Acer pennsylvanicum, Carya spp., Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) were never found in the soil seed bank, despite high seed production and germination. For three species, a substantial proportion of seeds available for germination came from dispersal events two or more years in the past (Acer rubrum 12-37%, Betula spp. 59-73%, Liriodendron tulipifera 40-76%), even though annual seed mortality was high (Acer rubrum 70-98%, Betula spp. 21-81%, Liriodendron tulipifera 12-59%). In years when no seeds fall in local microsites (approximately one in five years), seed banks are the only source of seedling recruitment for these species. Comparing our results to those of previous studies led to valuable insights: first, that seeds of Acer rubrum and Betula spp. suffer high mortality while being incorporated into the seed bank; and second, that seed decay varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales (i.e., within a watershed). Taken together, these results demonstrate that seed banking may play a critical role during woody seedling recruitment in temperate forests.},

	Abstract = {Humans are the dominant ecological and evolutionary force on the planet today, transforming habitats, polluting environments, changing climates, introducing new species, and causing other species to decline in number or go extinct. These worrying anthropogenic impacts, collectively termed global change, are often viewed as a confounding factor to minimize in basic studies and a problem to resolve or quantify in applied studies. However, these accidental experiments' also represent opportunities to gain fundamental insight into ecological and evolutionary processes, especially when they result in perturbations that are large or long in duration and difficult or unethical to impose experimentally. We demonstrate this by describing important fundamental insights already gained from studies which utilize global change factors as accidental experiments. In doing so, we highlight why accidental experiments are sometimes more likely to yield insights than traditional approaches. Next, we argue that emerging environmental problems can provide even more opportunities for scientific discovery in the future, and provide both examples and guidelines for moving forward. We recommend 1) a greater flow of information between basic and applied subfields of ecology and evolution to identify emerging opportunities; 2) considering the advantages of the accidental experiment' approach relative to more traditional approaches; and 3) planning for the challenges inherent to uncontrolled accidental experiments. We emphasize that we do not view the accidental experiments provided by global change as replacements for scientific studies quantifying the magnitude of anthropogenic impacts or outlining strategies for mitigating impacts. Instead, we believe that accidental experiments are uniquely situated to provide insights into evolutionary and ecological processes that ultimately allow us to better predict and manage change on our human-dominated planet. Synthesis Humans have an increasingly large impact on the planet. In response, ecologists and evolutionary biologists are dedicating increasing scientific attention to global change, largely with studies documenting biological effects and testing strategies to avoid or reverse negative impacts. In this article, we analyze global change from a different perspective, and suggest that human impacts on the environment also serve as valuable accidental experiments' that can provide fundamental scientific insight. We highlight and synthesize examples of studies taking this approach, and give guidance for gaining future insights from these unfortunate accidental experiments'.},

In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change-induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change-induced range shifts.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method.

Moreover, this study shows that this induction can be maternally transmitted, increasing trichome density in progeny before they experience herbivory. This transgenerational response must involve a yet undescribed epigenetic mechanism. These experiments also show genetic variation among plants in the capacity for both within and between plant generation induction.

Inbreeding alters the balance of evolutionary forces that determine the amount of genetic variation within a population. It redistributes that variation among individuals, altering heritabilities and genetic correlations. Inbreeding even changes the basic relationships between these genetic statistics and response to selection. If populations differing only in mating system are exposed to the same selection pressures, will they respond in qualitatively different ways? Here, we address this question by imposing selection on an index of two negatively correlated traits (flower size and development rate) within experimental populations that reproduce entirely by outcrossing, entirely by self-fertilizing, or by a mixture of outcrossing and selling. Entirely selfing populations responded mainly by evolving larger flowers whereas outcrossing populations also evolved more rapid development. Divergence occurred despite an equivalent selection regime and no direct effect of mating system on fitness. The study provides an experimental demonstration of how the interaction of selection, genetic drift, and mating system can produce dramatic short-term changes in trait means, variances, and covariances.},

	Abstract = {Tropical forests are being cleared at an alarming rate although our understanding of their ecology is limited. It is therefore essential to design restoration experiments that both further our basic knowledge of tropical ecology and inform management strategies to facilitate recovery of these ecosystems. Here we synthesize the results of research on tropical montane forest recovery in abandoned pasture in Costa Rica to address the following questions: (1) What factors limit tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture? and (2) How can we use this information to design strategies to facilitate ecosystem recovery? Our results indicate that a number of factors impede tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture land. The most important barriers are lack of dispersal of forest seeds and seedling competition with pasture grasses. High seed predation, low seed germination, lack of nutrients, high light intensity, and rabbit herbivory also affect recovery. Successful strategies to facilitate recovery in abandoned pastures must simultaneously overcome numerous obstacles. Our research shows that establishment of woody species, either native tree seedlings or early-successional shrubs, can be successful in facilitating recovery, by enhancing seed dispersal and shading out pasture grasses. On the contrary, bird perching structures alone are not an effective strategy, because they only serve to enhance seed dispersal but do not reduce grass cover. Remnant pasture trees can serve as foci of natural recovery and may enhance growth of planted seedlings. Our results highlight the importance of: (1) understanding the basic biology of an ecosystem to design effective restoration strategies; (2) comparing results across a range of sites to determine which restoration strategies are most generally useful; and (3) considering where best to allocate efforts in large-scale restoration projects.},

	Abstract = {If plants cannot simultaneously acclimate to shade and drought because of physiological trade-offs, then plants are expected to be less tolerant to shading under drier conditions. One observation that, at first sight, seems incompatible with this idea is the fact that the establishment of new plants in dry areas is often restricted to shady sites under the canopy of other plants, called ''nurse plants.'' We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth response of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light-water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed. The model shows how changes in water availability may shift interactions from competitive to facilitative and vice versa, as observed in some field patterns. It is argued that other environmental factors explaining facilitative patterns can be understood in the same context.},

	Abstract = {Aim To examine range-wide patterns of genetic diversity in association with range limits in a broadly distributed temperate lizard, and to identify the contributions of a series of environmental, geographical and historical variables to the observed patterns. Reduced genetic diversity may limit local adaptation in peripheral populations, thereby limiting their ability to adapt to marginal environmental conditions, possibly explaining the existence of temporally stable range limits. Location Various sampling locales throughout eastern and central USA and southern Ontario, Canada. Methods Genetic diversity of nuclear DNA microsatellites was estimated for each of 38 populations from across the range of eastern North America's most broadly distributed lizard, the five-lined skink, Plestiodon fasciatus (Linnaeus, 1758). Results Local climatic conditions and an interaction between distance from range border and glaciation history best predicted a population's present-day genetic diversity. Overall, peripheral populations had reduced genetic diversity relative to that of central populations, but this difference was attributable to the reduced genetic diversity in peripheral populations to the north and west that are not bordered by any obvious physical boundaries. Main conclusions Some, but not all, peripheral populations had reduced genetic diversity relative to that of more central populations, which probably arose through an interaction of ecological and historical factors. Peripheral populations that were bordered by an obvious boundary (e.g. an ocean) had higher diversity than peripheral populations that were not bordered by an obvious physical barrier to range expansion, suggesting that reduced intrapopulation genetic diversity is associated with range limits in the five-lined skink.},

It is likely that they originated from independent evolutionary events. While M. guttatus sensu stricto is a bodenvag species, found both on ultramafic and normal soils, there are other species in the complex that are apparently excluded from serpentine, including M. nasutus Greene and M. marmoratus Greene. Field observations suggest that response to drought is a major factor in determining Mimulus species distribution and thus possibly the evolution of the two endemics. We compared these five species for their physiological responses to drought. All species were very drought sensitive, and few differences were found among them. However, significant differences were found in the pressure/volume curves, suggesting that the endemics are more drought tolerant. From crosses between M. pardalis (serpentine endemic) and M. marmoratus (excluded from serpentine) a set of recombinant inbred (RI) lines were isolated. The RI lines were characterized for their tolerance to serpentine and drought; there was a significant positive correlation between drought and serpentine tolerance. The nickel tolerance of the RI lines was not correlated with their serpentine tolerance. Our results support the hypothesis that drought is the main driving force in the evolution of serpentine tolerance in this group of species.},

	Abstract = {Estimation of a population trend from a time series of abundance data is an important task in ecology, yet such estimation remains logistically and conceptually challenging in practice. First, the extent to which unequal intervals in the time series, due to missing observations or irregular sampling, compromise trend estimation is not well-known. Furthermore, the predominant trend estimation method (loglinear regression of abundance data against time) ignores the possibility of process noise, while an alternative method (the 'diffusion approximation') ignores observation error in the abundance data. State-space models that account for both process noise and observation error exist but have been little used. We study an adaptation of the exponential growth state-space (EGSS) model for use with missing data in the time series, and we compare its trend estimation to the status quo methods. The EGSS model provides superior estimates of trend across wide ranges of time series length and sources of variation. The performance of the EGSS model even with half of the counts in the time series missing implies that trend estimates may be improved by diverting effort away from annual monitoring and towards increasing time series length or improving precision of the abundance estimates for years that data are collected.},

	Abstract = {Predicting vegetation shifts under climate change is a challenging endeavor, given the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that influence demographic rates. To determine how current trends and variation in climate change affect seedling establishment, we analyzed demographic responses to spatiotemporal variation to temperature and soil moisture in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We monitored seedling establishment for 10 years in five plots located along an elevational gradient of five dominant tree species: Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulip fera, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus rubra. A hierarchical Bayes model allowed us to incorporate different sources of information, observation errors, and the inherent variability of the establishment process. From our analysis, spring temperatures and heterogeneity in soil moisture emerge as key drivers, and they act through nonlinear population demographic processes. We found that all species benefited from warmer springs, in particular the species found on dry slopes, N.sylvatica, and those dominant at higher elevations, Betula spp. and Q. rubra. This last species also benefited from dry environments. Conversely, L. tulipifera, which is abundant on mesic sites, experienced highest establishment rates at high moisture. The mechanisms behind these results may differ among species. Higher temperatures are apparently more important for some, while dry conditions and reduced pathogenic attacks on their seeds and new seedlings have a large impact for others. Our results suggest that only communities found at higher elevations are in danger of regional extinction when their habitats disappear given the current climatic trends. We conclude that the recruitment dynamics of the communities where these species are dominant could be affected by minor changes in climate in ways that cannot be predicted using only climate envelopes, which use different variables and miss the nonlinearities.},

	Abstract = {As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and autumn phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the length of the growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953-2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the present work was a comparison of the age and spatial structure of two populations of Taxus baccata in the Kornik Arboretum, formed spontaneously under different initial conditions. The first of them (plot one) comes from at least 11, while the second (plot two) from only two, potential mother tress at a distance up to about 100 in. The influence of the local climate conditions on the seedlings was also analyzed. Age structure of the population formed from 11 mother trees was found to be typical for young, but developing populations of shade tolerant trees about 40 years after the first cohorts were founded. The youngest seedlings formed the most numerous age class, still without saplings. The class ranking next consisted of tree-like specimens of the highest age. Obviously, the population of the first plot was formed by only few cohorts of seeds, in period of about 20 years. Seedlings may have appeared every year, but most often nearly all of them died. The sub-population on the second plot, developed as offspring from only two close-by growing mother trees, was formed during much a longer period and is characterized by a different age structure. The oldest individuals are less numerous as those in subpopulation one. There is also a number of saplings, which are still joining the main stand; such saplings were not found in the other sub-population. The spatial structure of two sub-populations is also different. The first of them, which comes from several mother trees, is characterized as rather uniform, while the second which can be traced back to two mother trees, shows a clump distribution of tree-like yews. The climate parameter limiting the number of surviving seedlings in particular years appears to be a minimal temperature below -7.5 &DEG; C in November. Temperatures of winter and spring, as well as the drought/precipitation regime during the vegetation period do not restrict the survival rate of the seedlings. Obviously, the distribution of individuals of the ornithochoric species T baccata is strongly determined by the availability of mother trees in a distance suitable to be bridged by birds. Long distances limit seed supply heavily and retard and prolong the period of colonization. As a consequence, dispersal distances influence strongly age and spatial structure of cohorts founded from isolated (groups of) mother trees. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Most models of mating system evolution predict mixed mating to be unstable, although it is commonly reported from nature. Ecological interactions with mutualistic pollinators can help account for this discrepancy, but antagonists such as herbivores are also likely to play a role. In addition, inbreeding can alter ecological interactions and directly affect selfing rates, which may also contribute to maintaining mating system variation. We explored herbivore and inbreeding effects on pollinator behavior and selfing rates in Mimulus guttatus. First, individual spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius) herbivores were applied to native plants in two populations. Spittlebugs reduced flower size, increased anther-stigma distance, and increased selfing rates. A second experiment factorially crossed spittlebug treatment with inbreeding history (self- vs. cross-fertilized), using potted plants in arrays. Spittlebugs did not affect pollinator behavior, but they reduced flower size and nearly doubled the selfing rate. Inbreeding reduced the frequency of pollinator visits and increased flower-handling time, and this may be the first report that inbreeding affects pollinator behavior. Selfing rates of inbred plants were reduced by one half, which may reflect early inbreeding depression or altered pollinator behavior. The contrasting effects of herbivory and inbreeding on selfing rates may help maintain mating system variation in M. guttattus.},

	Abstract = {Inbreeding, which is common in plants, may increase the vulnerability of. populations to natural enemies. Similarly, natural enemies may increase the expression of inbreeding depression in their hosts, resulting in altered selection on host mating-system evolution. To examine effects of inbreeding on tolerance to herbivory, we transplanted experimentally self- and cross-fertilized plants into four field populations of Mimulus guttatus and applied single Philaenus spumarius (spittlebug) nymphs to half. At the end of the growing season, we scored plants for five fitness components (reproductive effort, biomass, survival, probability of producing flowers or buds, and probability of bolting). Inbreeding reduced population-level tolerance to spittlebug herbivory with respect to plant aboveground biomass. Inbreeding effects on tolerance varied significantly among plant families for three fitness traits, indicating the opportunity for selection by herbivores to improve tolerance in in breeding populations. These results also indicate that herbivores can alter inbreeding depression in plants. Our results mirror earlier greenhouse studies of inbreeding effects on plant-herbivore interactions, and demonstrate that these effects can be manifested in natural settings as well. This study indicates that inbreeding in natural populations can affect fitness not only directly, but also indirectly through altered interactions with natural enemies.},

	Abstract = {P>1. In woodland herbs, the probability of flowering and costs associated with reproduction may strongly depend on environmental context (shade vs. light habitats) and on plant size. This may be particularly true for tuberous orchids that inhabit woodlands, as the amount of incoming radiation and total leaf area strongly determine photosynthetic capacity and hence the amount of carbohydrates that can be relocated to below-ground storage organs that form next year's rosette and flowering stalk. 2. To fully comprehend the impact of size-dependent reproduction on population dynamics under varying light conditions, life cycle models should therefore include plant size in a continuous manner. In this study, annual changes in plant size and demographic behaviour of the tuberous perennial orchid Orchis purpurea were monitored during seven consecutive years (2003-2009) in open and shaded woodland. Integral projection models (IPMs) and life table response experiments (LTRE) were used to investigate the extent to which variation in plant size affected the overall population dynamics of this species and to decompose differences in population growth rates between populations of open and shaded woodland into contributions from growth, survival and reproduction. 3. Both plants in shaded and light environments needed to be a certain size to initiate flowering, but this threshold size was almost three times as large in shaded environments as in light environments. Plants in open woodlands flowered more frequently over the years, showed less size regression after flowering and produced significantly more fruits than plants in shaded environments, resulting in significantly larger population growth rates. 4. Our life cycle models revealed that costs of reproduction, measured at the population-level, were small in the light environment, and more than buffered by the increase in survival of flowering plants compared to non-flowering plants. In the shade environment, however, the costs of reproduction were significant and made the difference between a stable (current) and a growing (without reproduction costs) population. 5. Synthesis. Light penetration to the soil is a key variable determining population dynamics of woodland orchids. Our analyses show that differences in vital rates related to size-dependent reproduction (flowering) and growth are essential drivers of changes in orchid population dynamics in different light environments. The combination of IPMs and LTREs thus proves to be very useful when studying the fitness consequences of size- and context-dependent phenomena like flowering strategies and costs of reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Aim Increases in annual mean temperature in the course of current climate change are expected to facilitate mass species migration towards higher altitudes and latitudes. However, this migration may be slowed, or even temporarily reversed, by infrequent and unpredictable episodes of low winter temperatures. Iran experienced a severe cold wave in January and February 2008, giving an opportunity to observe the effects on a large number of woody plant species, many growing further north than their natural ranges. Location The study was carried out in the National Botanical Garden of Iran (35 degrees 44'20.06 ' N; 51 degrees 10'25.66 ' E). Method To estimate the damage caused to each individual woody plant in the garden, we adopted the following protocol; at the start of the growing season, at the end of March and beginning of April 2008, all woody species were inspected for damage. In the case of evergreens this took the form of obvious damage to foliage, usually manifested as severe browning. In the case of deciduous species, damage was recognized by the failure of all or part of the plant to produce new leaves; all affected individual plants were labelled. In July all labelled plants were rechecked and, based on whole or partial above-ground die-back, a final list of damaged individuals was produced. Results As expected, the majority of native and exotic species introduced from cold temperate habitats showed no freezing injuries. Many woody species in the garden were damaged or killed, despite their previous survival and growth, in many cases for up to 40 years. The majority of taxa (101 out of a total of 145) that suffered freezing-induced damage were evergreens. Main conclusions The results indicate that despite an increase in mean annual temperature, unpredictable lethal cold waves may retard the expansion of plants towards higher altitudes and latitudes. Broadleaved evergreen species from warm climates were particularly badly affected, with many species suffering high rates of mortality.},

	Abstract = {Tropical montane species are characterized by narrow elevational distributions. Recent perspectives on mechanisms maintaining these restricted distributions have emphasized abiotic processes, but biotic processes may also play a role in their establishment or maintenance. One historically popular hypothesis, especially for birds, is that interspecific competition constrains ranges of closely related species that "replace" each other along elevational gradients. Supporting evidence, however, is based on patterns of occurrence and does not reveal potential mechanisms. We experimentally tested a prediction of this hypothesis in two genera of tropical songbirds, Catharus (Turdidae) and Henicorhina (Troglodytidae), in which species have nonoverlapping elevational distributions. Using heterospeci. c playback trials, we found that individuals at replacement zones showed aggressive territorial behavior in response to songs of congeners. As distance from replacement zones increased, aggression toward congener song decreased, suggesting a learned component to interspecific aggression. Additionally, aggressive responses in Catharus were asymmetric, indicating interspecific dominance. These results provide experimental evidence consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific competitive interactions restrict ranges of Neotropical birds. Our results also underscore the need to consider biotic processes, such as competition, when predicting how species' ranges will shift with climate change. Asymmetric aggression could be particularly important. For example, if warming in montane landscapes allows upslope range expansion by dominant competitors, then high-elevation subordinate species could be forced into progressively smaller mountaintop habitats, jeopardizing viability of their populations.},

	Abstract = {Variations in Earth's orbit with periods of 10-100 thousand years (kyr) (Milankovitch oscillations) have led to recurrent and rapid climatic shifts throughout Earth's history. These cause changes in the geographical distributions of clades, which we term orbitally forced range dynamics (ORD). The magnitude of ORD varies geographically, e.g., with latitude. Climatic shifts cause extinction, splitting, and merging of gene pools and clades. They select among individuals and clades for traits enhancing the ability to survive in situ and to establish new populations. There is also nonadaptive sorting caused by the large geographical variation in ORD, as only gene pools that are in the right place when climate shifts survive. ORD lead to sorting at many levels of genealogic inclusiveness. Clades that have survived climatic shifts during at least one entire period of the longest significant Milankovitch oscillations (100 kyr), we name beta-clades. The products of more recent cladogenesis are alpha-clades, which are always nested within a beta-clade. We conclude that ORD may promote alpha-clade formation but curb rates of beta-clade formation. In areas with little ORD, where gene pools persist without going extinct or merging, clade splits and divergence may accumulate leading to high rates of beta-clade formation and beta-anagenesis (evolutionary change persisting > 100 kyr). High ORD should lead to low numbers of beta-clades, beta-clades with low levels of spatial genetic divergence, little geographical subdivision and large ranges, organisms with high vagility and low specialization, high proportions of beta-clades formed by polyploidization, and little beta-anagenesis. We predict global and interregional geographic patterns in these variables caused by differential ORD. Thus, ORD potentially explains a wide array of patterns, suggesting ORD as a fundamental factor in evolution. The vulnerability of biotas to many human activities should vary with the magnitude of ORD.},

	Abstract = {Factors shaping overall species richness and representation of endangered species of vascular flora and butterflies were determined in 48 nature reserves in Prague, Czech Republic. Total species richness of both groups, and the presence of endangered butterflies, reflect the present status of habitats, while that of endangered plants reflects habitat composition at the time of reserve establishment. Reserve area has a much stronger effect on the species richness of sessile plants than mobile butterflies which, especially endangered species, respond more positively to heterogeneity than to area. Both species richness and endangered species peak in reserves half covered with forest, likely because they harbor species of both woodland and non-woodland habitats, and edge specialists. Solely relying on area and disregarding habitat quality, or a failure to conserve small but high quality sites, may be counterproductive for conserving endangered plant and butterfly species. To conserve diversity of plants and butterflies current management practices, often aimed at maintaining large blocks of pre-selected plant communities, should change to include maintenance of fallows, edges and transient zones.

	Abstract = {Beyond the effects of temperature increase on local population trends and on species distribution shifts, how populations of a given species are affected by climate change along a species range is still unclear. We tested whether and how species responses to climate change are related to the populations locations within the species thermal range. We compared the average 20 year growth rates of 62 terrestrial breeding birds in three European countries along the latitudinal gradient of the species ranges. After controlling for factors already reported to affect bird population trends (habitat specialization, migration distance and body mass), we found that populations breeding close to the species thermal maximum have lower growth rates than those in other parts of the thermal range, while those breeding close to the species thermal minimum have higher growth rates. These results were maintained even after having controlled for the effect of latitude per se. Therefore, the results cannot solely be explained by latitudinal clines linked to the geographical structure in local spring warming. Indeed, we found that populations are not just responding to changes in temperature at the hottest and coolest parts of the species range, but that they show a linear graded response across their European thermal range. We thus provide insights into how populations respond to climate changes. We suggest that projections of future species distributions, and also management options and conservation assessments, cannot be based on the assumption of a uniform response to climate change across a species range or at range edges only.},

	Abstract = {Long-term phenology monitoring has documented numerous examples of changing flowering dates during the last century. A pivotal question is whether these phenological responses are adaptive or not under directionally changing climatic conditions. We use a classic dynamic growth model for annual plants, based on optimal control theory, to find the fitness-maximizing flowering time, defined as the switching time from vegetative to reproductive growth. In a typical scenario of global warming, with advanced growing season and increased productivity, optimal flowering time advances less than the start of the growing season. Interestingly, increased temporal spread in production over the season may either advance or delay the optimal flowering time depending on overall productivity or season length. We identify situations where large phenological changes are necessary for flowering time to remain optimal. Such changes also indicate changed selection pressures. In other situations, the model predicts advanced phenology on a calendar scale, but no selection for early flowering in relation to the start of the season. We also show that the optimum is more sensitive to increased productivity when productivity is low than when productivity is high. All our results are derived using a general, graphical method to calculate the optimal flowering time applicable for a large range of shapes of the seasonal production curve. The model can thus explain apparent maladaptation in phenological responses in a multitude of scenarios of climate change. We conclude that taking energy allocation trade-offs and appropriate time scales into account is critical when interpreting phenological patterns.},

	Abstract = {Although mutualisms have been intensively investigated, demonstration of indirect effects between co-occurring mutualistic systems is rare. For instance, the ecological consequences of co-occurrence of ant-tended insects on a plant have never been examined for survival effects on either trophobiont species. Here, we assess the selective pressures mediating co-occurrence of a facultative ant-tended butterfly (Parrhasius polibetes) with ant-tended treehoppers (Guayaquila xiphias) on Schefflera vinosa shrubs. We evaluated host plant selection and caterpillar survival in P. polibetes in the presence and absence of ant-treehopper associations. Paired trials revealed that butterflies preferably oviposit on branches hosting ant-tended treehoppers when they had a choice between those and branches without this interaction. Presence of ant-tended treehoppers on a branch reduced the abundance of P. polibetes' natural enemies and improved caterpillar survival in both premyrmecophylic and ant-tended phases. Thus ant-tended treehoppers create an enemy-free space on foliage that butterflies exploit to protect larval offspring. These findings connect two widely documented ant-trophobiont mutualisms and highlight the importance of considering multiple interactions for a proper understanding of ant-plant-herbivore systems. Detection of other ant-based mutualisms on oviposition to improve offspring survival may have represented an important evolutionary step in the process of host plant selection in facultative myrmecophilous butterflies.},

	Abstract = {Urban habitats, particularly wastelands and brownfields, maintain rich biodiversity and offer habitat for many species, even rare and endangered taxa. However, such habitats are also under socio-economic pressures due to redevelopment for housing and industrial uses. In order to maintain urban biodiversity, it is currently unknown how much open area must be preserved and whether conservation is possible without complete exclusion from economic development. In this study, we applied a simulation model based on species distribution models for plants, grasshoppers, and leafhoppers to investigate planning options for urban conservation with special focus on business areas. Altogether, we modelled the occurrence of 81 species of the urban species pool and analysed settings of different proportions of open sites, different habitat turnover times, and different lot sizes. Our simulations demonstrated that dynamic land use supports urban biodiversity in terms of species richness and rarity. Setting aside brownfields before redevelopment for a period of on average 15 years supported the highest conservation value. Consequently, we recommend integrating the concept of 'temporary conservation' into urban planning for industrial and business areas. This concept requires habitat to be destroyed by redeveloping brownfield sites to built-up sites, but simultaneously creating new open spaces due to abandonment of urban land uses at other locations. This maintains a spatio-temporal mosaic of different successional stages ranging from pioneer to pre-forest communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, temporal changes in the time of spring fruiting in Norway and the UK during 1960-2007 have been investigated by statistical analyses of about 6000 herbarium and field records, covering 34 species. Nearly 30 per cent of the temporal variation in fruiting could be ascribed to spatial and species-specific effects. Correcting for these effects, linear trends towards progressively earlier fruiting were detected during the entire period in both Norway and the UK, with a change in average fruiting day of 18 days over the study period. Early fruiting was correlated with high winter temperatures in both countries, indicating that the observed phenological changes are likely due to earlier onset of spring. There were also significant correlations between climatic conditions in one year and timing of fruiting the following year, indicating that below-ground mycelia are influenced by climatic conditions over a longer time period before fruiting. Fruiting dates were, however, not strictly related to changes in vernal accumulated thermal time. Our results indicate that global warming has lead to progressively earlier fruiting of spring fungi in northwest Europe during the last half century.},

	Abstract = {Many species of fungi produce ephemeral autumnal fruiting bodies to spread and multiply. Despite their attraction for mushroom pickers and their economic importance, little is known about the phenology of fruiting bodies. Using approximate to 34,500 dated herbarium records we analyzed changes in the autumnal fruiting date of mushrooms in Norway over the period 1940-2006. We show that the time of fruiting has changed considerably over this time period, with an average delay in fruiting since 1980 of 12.9 days. The changes differ strongly between species and groups of species. Early-fruiting species have experienced a stronger delay than late fruiters, resulting in a more compressed fruiting season. There is also a geographic trend of earlier fruiting in the northern and more continental parts of Norway than in more southern and oceanic parts. Incorporating monthly precipitation and temperature variables into the analyses provides indications that increasing temperatures during autumn and winter months bring about significant delay of fruiting both in the same year and in the subsequent year. The recent changes in autumnal mushroom phenology coincide with the extension of the growing season caused by global climate change and are likely to continue under the current climate change scenario.},

	Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

	Abstract = {Biological legacies left by natural disturbances provide ecological functions throughout forest stand development, but their influences on processes of ecological succession are not completely understood. We investigated the successional role of one type of biological legacy: remnant old-growth trees persisting in mature Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) forests in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We tested the hypothesis that remnant old-growth Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) and Thuja plicata (western red cedar) trees enhance the reestablishment of shade-tolerant conifers by increasing the availability of seed. Reestablishment of shade-tolerant conifers is a key process in late-successional forest development because it leads to vertical differentiation of the canopy and eventual codominance of shade-tolerant species. Two study areas were selected in the southern Washington Cascade Range, USA. Both had an unfragmented, mature forest cover that was regenerated naturally following wildfire. Twelve study sites were selected, including sites with and without remnant T. plicata and T. heterophylla. Overstory structure and composition, microsite variables, and conifer regeneration were systematically sampled using nested belt transects and quadrats. Sites with remnant T. heterophylla and T plicata had significantly higher densities of conspecific seedlings. Multivariate analyses showed remnant T. heterophylla and T. plicata presence and density to be the strongest predictors of seedling densities, although the basal area of mature conspecific trees, relative density, aspect, stand age, and microsite characteristics were important secondary predictors. Microsite variations explained regeneration patchiness. Seedling densities were strongly correlated with proximity to remnant trees, exhibiting a negative exponential decline with distance. Shade-tolerant conifers are likely to reestablish faster at sites with remnant seed trees, but canopy. disturbances are probably necessary for subsequent height growth. Remnant shade-tolerant conifers are an important biological legacy and seed source influencing rates of ecological succession in mature P. menziesii stands. Successional and stand development models should explicitly incorporate this dynamic.},

With inbreeding, V-A is not the only relevant component of genetic variation. Several nonadditive components emerge from the combined effects of inbreeding and genetic dominance. An important empirical question is whether these components are quantitatively significant. We use maximum likelihood estimation to extract estimates for V-A and the nonadditive 'inbreeding components' from an experimental study of the wildflower Mimulus guttatus. The inbreeding components contribute significantly to four of five floral traits, including several measures of flower size and stigma-anther separation. These results indicate that inbreeding will substantially alter the evolutionary response to natural selection on floral characters.},

@article{RefWorks:1269,
	Abstract = {Small populations are often at risk of extinction through processes that are effectively stochastic. Prediction of this extinction risk requires that the observed temporal variation in demographic rates be accurately partitioned between demographic stochasticity (variation among individuals) and environmental stochasticity (variation among years, correlated across individuals). However, studies of population viability analysis that include both forms of stochasticity parameterize the magnitude of environmental stochasticity incorrectly (they overestimate it). I describe and evaluate tests (1) to determine whether all the year-to-year variation in observed survivorship can be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, and (2) if not, to estimate the magnitude of environmental stochasticity in survival. The first issue can be resolved with a G test. I used simulated data to show that this test has an appropriate type I error rate, unless the individual survival probability is either very low or very high. Small amounts of environmental stochasticity often are not detected by the G test (type II error), but the hypothesis of demographic stochasticity alone is consistently rejected when environmental stochasticity is large. In contrast, estimating the magnitude of environmental stochasticity requires explicit hypotheses about the nature of the underlying variation, but I provide a flexible framework in which many such hypotheses can be examined. In particular, I show, using simulated data, that if the temporal variability in individual survival probabilities is distributed according to a beta distribution, then the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the survival probability is biased, but in a consistent and correctable way. The estimate obtained with my method is usually superior to an estimate that assumes that all of the variation in the observed survivorship is due to environmental stochasticity. I show how to include deterministic sources of variability, such as density dependence, and how to apply different assumptions about the underlying environmental stochasticity. I illustrate these tests with data from a population of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). With these data, I can determine that there is strong environmental stochasticity in juvenile survival, whereas variation in adult survival can be explained either by density dependence or by weak environmental stochasticity.},

Such studies neglect the fact that a population may be overlooked, however, which may bias estimates of extinction rates upward. In addition, if populations are unequally detectable across groups to be compared, such as habitat type or population size, comparisons become distorted to an unknown degree. To illustrate the problem, I simulated two data sets, assuming a constant extinction rate, in which populations occurred in different habitats or habitats of different size and these factors affected their detectability. The conventional analysis implicitly assumed that detectability equalled I and used logistic regression to estimate extinction rates. It wrongly identified habitat and population size as factors affecting extinction risk. In contrast, with capture-recapture methods, unbiased estimates of extinction rates were recovered.

	Abstract = {Demographic estimation of vital parameters in plants with an unobservable dormant state is complicated, because time of death is not known. Conventional methods assume that death occurs at a particular time after a plant has last been seen aboveground but the consequences of assuming a particular duration of dormancy have never been tested. Capture-recapture methods do not make assumptions about time of death; however, problems with parameter estimability have not yet been resolved. To date, a critical comparative assessment of these methods is lacking. We analysed data from a 10 year study of Cleistes bifaria, a terrestrial orchid with frequent dormancy, and compared demographic estimates obtained by five varieties of the conventional methods, and two capture-recapture methods. All conventional methods produced spurious unity survival estimates for some years or for some states, and estimates of demographic rates sensitive to the time of death assumption. In contrast, capture-recapture methods are more parsimonious in terms of assumptions, are based on well founded theory and did not produce spurious estimates. In Cleistes, dormant episodes lasted for 1-4 years (mean 1.4, SD 0.74). The capture-recapture models estimated ramet survival rate at 0.86 (SEsimilar to0.01), ranging from 0.77-0.94 (SEsless than or equal to0.1) in any one year. The average fraction dormant was estimated at 30% (SE 1.5), ranging 16-47% (SEsless than or equal to5.1) in any one year. Multistate capture-recapture models showed that survival rates were positively related to precipitation in the current year, but transition rates were more strongly related to precipitation in the previous than in the current year, with more ramets going dormant following dry years. Not all capture-recapture models of interest have estimable parameters; for instance, without excavating plants in years when they do not appear aboveground, it is not possible to obtain independent time-specific survival estimates for dormant plants. We introduce rigorous computer algebra methods to identify the parameters that are estimable in principle. As life-states are a prominent feature in plant life cycles, multistate capture-recapture models are a natural framework for analysing population dynamics of plants with dormancy.},

	Abstract = {Foldit is a multiplayer online game in which players collaborate and compete to create accurate protein structure models. For specific hard problems, Foldit player solutions can in some cases outperform state-of-the-art computational methods. However, very little is known about how collaborative gameplay produces these results and whether Foldit player strategies can be formalized and structured so that they can be used by computers. To determine whether high performing player strategies could be collectively codified, we augmented the Foldit gameplay mechanics with tools for players to encode their folding strategies as "recipes" and to share their recipes with other players, who are able to further modify and redistribute them. Here we describe the rapid social evolution of player-developed folding algorithms that took place in the year following the introduction of these tools. Players developed over 5,400 different recipes, both by creating new algorithms and by modifying and recombining successful recipes developed by other players. The most successful recipes rapidly spread through the Foldit player population, and two of the recipes became particularly dominant. Examination of the algorithms encoded in these two recipes revealed a striking similarity to an unpublished algorithm developed by scientists over the same period. Benchmark calculations show that the new algorithm independently discovered by scientists and by Foldit players outperforms previously published methods. Thus, online scientific game frameworks have the potential not only to solve hard scientific problems, but also to discover and formalize effective new strategies and algorithms.},

	Abstract = {The Great Lakes region possesses over 10,000 miles of shoreline (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) which are home to over 1,000 beaches. These beaches represent a recreational outlet for over 30 million people (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) and yet many of them remain inaccessible for periods of time each bathing season due to water quality advisories. The reason for these advisories is often elusive to beach managers, hence impeding their ability to craft appropriate mitigation measures. Even when the sources of contamination are known, remediation measures may not be put into practice due to the perception that they are too costly. However, a recent study has demonstrated that investing in environmental improvements which increase the number of days available for swimming in the Great Lakes region by 20% would generate $2-$3 billion dollars in direct economic effects. Therefore, while beach closings and advisories continue to rise overall, some Great Lakes communities have recognized the potential for municipal beaches to generate revenue and increase the quality of life for their citizens and have undertaken comprehensive studies to improve recreational water quality. In Racine, Wisconsin, USA, research conducted to identify pollution sources guided the development of better beach management practices such as ecologically appropriate beach modifications, improved mechanical beach grooming strategies, and the redesign of a major storm water outlet (including installation of a constructed wetland area). Resulting improvements have reduced bathing water quality advisories from 66% of days during the swimming season in 2000 to 5% or less in four consecutive years (2005-2008). These improvements to Racine beaches facilitated Blue Wave certification from the Clean Beaches Council (Washington, DC); thereby restoring public confidence, increasing beach use by the residents and tourists, and expanding the role of the beachfront in the local economy.},

	Abstract = {Two species of monkey-flowers (Mimulus guttatus and M. lewisii) differ in their microdistributions along small slow-moving streams in western Washington state: M. guttatus generally grows in the streambeds with moss mats whereas M. lewisii generally or,rows on the streambanks where moss does not occur. Interactions with the moss might help explain these differences in microdistribution. Moss mats that occupy the streambeds might have differential effects on either the establishment or subsequent growth of these monkey-flowers. Alternatively, different tolerances of inundation could help explain the differences in microdistribution. We carried out greenhouse experiments designed to understand the potential for moss and inundation to explain the differences in microhabitat occupation of the two Mimulus species. Moss mats essentially eliminated successful seedling establishment in M. lewisii but allowed establishment of a reduced number of M. guttatus seedlings. Growth of established seedlings of M. lewisii was enhanced by surrounding moss mats whereas growth of M. guttatus was unaffected or reduced. Inundation increased growth rates of both species similarly. Therefore, differential effects of moss on seedling establishment might explain the observed differences in microdistribution.},

	Abstract = {Aim Biotic interactions within guilds or across trophic levels have widely been ignored in species distribution models (SDMs). This synthesis outlines the development of species interaction distribution models (SIDMs), which aim to incorporate multispecies interactions at large spatial extents using interaction matrices. Location Local to global. Methods We review recent approaches for extending classical SDMs to incorporate biotic interactions, and identify some methodological and conceptual limitations. To illustrate possible directions for conceptual advancement we explore three principal ways of modelling multispecies interactions using interaction matrices: simple qualitative linkages between species, quantitative interaction coefficients reflecting interaction strengths, and interactions mediated by interaction currencies. We explain methodological advancements for static interaction data and multispecies time series, and outline methods to reduce complexity when modelling multispecies interactions. Results Classical SDMs ignore biotic interactions and recent SDM extensions only include the unidirectional influence of one or a few species. However, novel methods using error matrices in multivariate regression models allow interactions between multiple species to be modelled explicitly with spatial co-occurrence data. If time series are available, multivariate versions of population dynamic models can be applied that account for the effects and relative importance of species interactions and environmental drivers. These methods need to be extended by incorporating the non-stationarity in interaction coefficients across space and time, and are challenged by the limited empirical knowledge on spatio-temporal variation in the existence and strength of species interactions. Model complexity may be reduced by: (1) using prior ecological knowledge to set a subset of interaction coefficients to zero, (2) modelling guilds and functional groups rather than individual species, and (3) modelling interaction currencies and species effect and response traits. Main conclusions There is great potential for developing novel approaches that incorporate multispecies interactions into the projection of species distributions and community structure at large spatial extents. Progress can be made by: (1) developing statistical models with interaction matrices for multispecies co-occurrence datasets across large-scale environmental gradients, (2) testing the potential and limitations of methods for complexity reduction, and (3) sampling and monitoring comprehensive spatio-temporal data on biotic interactions in multispecies communities.},

	Abstract = {The population dynamics of two polycarpic perennials, Agrimonia eupatoria and Geum rivale, characteristic of semi-natural grasslands in Scandinavia, were examined in south-eastern Sweden. The perennial forbs were studied for several years in two populations each, located in habitats characteristic for the species in the study area. Demographic transition probabilities varied significantly between populations and among years for the species. Transition matrix modelling yielded lambda-values (population growth rates) that ranged from 0.89 to 1.14 for A. eupatoria and from 0.94 to 1.04 for G. rivale. The elasticity analysis showed that stasis in the adult stage classes contributed most to lambda. The life-table response experiment analysis produced similar results as the elasticity analysis, where stasis together with progression in the adult stage classes made a large contribution to the observed spatial variation in lambda. Simulations of expected time to extinction were in the order of centuries for the study populations. Seedling recruitment was enhanced by seed addition and small scale disturbance in populations. For the intermediately abundant and more patchily distributed A. eupatoria, a regional survey of local populations was conducted in the study area which revealed that most populations were relatively small (< 100 individuals) and restricted to grassland fragments in road verges. Furthermore, an attempt was made to estimate fruit dispersal from local populations.},

	Abstract = {Environmental uncertainty alone can select for delayed reproduction; however, its relative role in the evolution of delayed reproduction across life histories is not known. Along a life-history spectrum from low-survival/high-fertility species to high-survival/low-fertility species, we show that the latter are more likely to evolve delayed reproduction if fertility varies over time. By contrast, if survival varies over time, low-survival life histories are more likely to evolve delays. If there is variation in both survival and fertility, and if this variation is positively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is decreased (relative to independent variation in survival and fertility). Conversely, if variation in survival and fertility is negatively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is increased. We further show that environmental uncertainty can drive the evolution of delayed reproduction in an iteroparous organism but only in the special case where juvenile survival is greater than adult survival. For common iteroparous life histories (adult survival 1 juvenile survival), environmental uncertainty does not select for delayed reproduction. Thus, any benefits that delayed reproduction might have on reproduction or survival could be especially important in explaining the common observation of delayed reproduction in many vertebrates and perennial plants.},

	Abstract = {Citizen science monitoring programs in the marine environment frequently focus on volunteer collected data precision for conservation and resource use of marine biota. Few studies have examined the social science aspects of volunteer engagement in marine monitoring programs in a quantifiable manner. This research focuses on emotional attitudes of Sea Search volunteers who monitor Marine National Parks and Marine Sanctuaries in Victoria, Australia. Volunteers responded that their participation in Sea Search activities made them feel good emotionally and mentally, with active learning, such as remembering names of marine biota, stimulating brain activity and memory. Volunteer monitoring efforts generated personal satisfaction through their contributions, feelings of enjoyment, and socialising with others. Sea Search volunteers gain a sense of want to protect and conserve the marine environment through positive behaviour change. By understanding and having a sense of meaning towards the marine environment, the volunteers felt a sense of pride in themselves. The concepts of volunteer connection to the natural environment and positive mental and emotional health are important for any citizen science monitoring program and should be used in the program's aims and strategies as an effective means to attract volunteers. A functional framework which clearly communicates and assesses not only the scientific expectations from a citizen science program, but also the health and wellbeing connections to nature, need to be addressed in Government marine and coastal strategies.

	Abstract = {Many biodiversity hotspots are in montane regions, and many plant and animal groups have their highest species richness at intermediate elevations. Yet, the explanation for this hump-shaped diversity pattern has remained unclear because no studies have addressed both the ecological and evolutionary causes. Here, we address these causes in North American plethodontid salamanders, using a near-comprehensive phylogeny and environmental data. We develop a null model for assessing the relationship between the time that an area has been occupied and its species richness, and we apply a new approach that tests whether clades exhibit long-term stasis in their climatic niches (niche conservatism). Evolutionarily, the midelevation peak in species richness is explained by the time-for-speciation effect, with intermediate-elevation habitats seemingly being inhabited longest and accumulating more species. We find that this pattern is associated with evolutionary stasis in species' climatic niches, driving the midelevation peak by constraining the dispersal of lineages to environments at lower and higher elevations. These processes may help explain elevational diversity patterns in many montane regions around the world. The results also suggest that montane biotas may harbor high levels of both species diversity and phylogenetic diversity but may be particularly susceptible to rapid climate change.},

The aim of this research was to investigate the global extent of living ex situ collections, to assess and discuss their viability and inform the development of conservation approaches that respond to latest global conservation challenges. We used as a model taxon the tree genus Zelkova (Ulmaceae). The genus includes six prominent Tertiary relict trees which survived the last glaciation in disjunct and isolated refugial regions. Our comprehensive worldwide survey shows that the majority of botanic institutions with Zelkova collections are in countries with a strong horticultural tradition and not in locations of their origin. More importantly, the acutely threatened Zelkova species are not the most represented in collections, and thus safeguarded through ex situ conservation. Less than 20% of the ex situ collections surveyed contain plant material of known wild provenance while the majority (90%) of collections are generally very small (1-10 trees). Botanic gardens and arboreta particularly in regions where iconic relict trees naturally occur should play a vital role in the conservation of these species. The coordination of conservation efforts between gardens has to be enhanced to prioritise action for the most threatened relict trees. Large scale genetic studies should be undertaken, ideally at genus level, in order to verify or clarify the provenance of ex situ collections of relict trees in cultivation. For the most threatened relict tree genera, well-coordinated specialist groups should be created.},

Naturally regenerated western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedlings were transplanted from mature forests into openings and the ECM fungal community was compared after 2 years with similar seedlings planted back into the forests or seedlings from openings planted back into openings. Fewer ECM morphotypes, lower average richness per seedling, and a steeper, less even species distribution curve were found, all of which suggest that the mature-forest ECM fungal community changed after transplanting forest seedlings into the openings. The increased abundance of pioneer fungi such as Thelephora terresteris suggested that many of the mature-forest ECM fungi were unable to maintain or continue root colonization in openings. Results suggest that many mature-forest ECM fungi require further stand development to maintain enough rooting density and hyphal contact to persist.},

These urban civic ecology practices including community gardening, shellfish reintroductions, tree planting and care, and "friends of parks" initiatives to remove invasive and restore native species generally begin as small, self-organized efforts after a prolonged period of economic and environmental decline or more sudden major disruptions, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and conflict. Those practices that are sustained expand to encompass partnerships with non-profit organizations; local-, state-, and federal-level government agencies; and universities. Civic ecology practices reflect local cultures and environments as well as the practical knowledge of city residents, and thus vary widely across different cities. When viewed as local assets in some of the most densely populated urban neighborhoods, civic ecology practices offer opportunities for scientific and policy partnerships that address the Ecological Society of America's important Earth Stewardship initiative.},

	Abstract = {Concerns about pollinator declines have grown in recent years, yet the ability to detect changes in abundance, taxonomic richness, and composition of pollinator communities is hampered severely by the lack of data over space and time. Citizen scientists may be able to extend the spatial and temporal extent of pollinator monitoring programs. We developed a citizen-science monitoring protocol in which we trained 13 citizen scientists to observe and classify floral visitors at the resolution of orders or super families (e. g., bee, wasp, fly) and at finer resolution within bees (superfamily Apoidea) only. We evaluated the protocol by comparing data collected simultaneously at 17 sites by citizen scientists (observational data set) and by professionals (specimen-based data set). The sites differed with respect to the presence and age of hedgerows planted to improve habitat quality for pollinators. We found significant, positive correlations among the two data sets for higher level taxonomic composition, honey bee (Apis mellifera) abundance, non-Apis bee abundance, bee richness, and bee community similarity. Results for both data sets also showed similar trends (or lack thereof) in these metrics among sites differing in the presence and age of hedgerows. Nevertheless, citizen scientists did not observe approximately half of the bee groups collected by professional scientists at the same sites. Thus, the utility of citizen-science observational data may be restricted to detection of community-level changes in abundance, richness, or similarity over space and time, and citizen-science observations may not reliably reflect the abundance or frequency of occurrence of specific pollinator species or groups.},

	Abstract = {1 Recent elevational range-margin performance of tree and shrub species was studied at a site in the Swedish Scandes. The methods included comparisons of historical and present-day range-margin records (in a.s.l.) in conjunction with age-determination of newly established saplings. 2 Since the early 1950s, the range-margins of Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa (mountain birch), Picea abies (Norway spruce), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) and Salix spp. (willows) have advanced by 120-375 in to colonize moderate snow-bed communities. The non-native Acer platanoides (Norway maple) has become established just below the birch forest-limit. In concert with tree-limit rises by 100-150 in in the same region, the present results suggest a shift in reproduction and a significant break in the late-Holocene vegetation history. 3 Ring-counting (in 2000) of a subsample of the recovered saplings revealed that, with one exception, they were aged between 7 and 12 years, i.e. they germinated after 1987. Since 1988 there has been strong and consistent winter warming, with some very warm summers, and this may ultimately have forced the vegetational changes. 4 Reduced summer snow-retention has favoured seedling establishment and juvenile growth, and mild winters, with reduced risk of frost-desiccation, have enhanced survivorship and height increment. 5 Certain seed-regenerating tree and shrub species have tracked recent climate change quite rapidly and more sensitively than vegetatively propagating field-layer species. Such species-specific responses may give rise to novel high-elevation vegetational patterns in a hypothetically warmer future world.},

	Abstract = {The mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large- scale outbreaks(1-3). During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.},

	Abstract = {This article relies on data from the 2005-09 World Values Survey to examine individual and cross-national variation in perception of the seriousness of global warming. The data show that a large majority of the public in all countries are concerned about the problem of global warming and that this assessment is part of a broader concern for global environmental issues. The widespread concern implies that global warming has the potential to generate mass political participation and demand for political action. Motivated by a value-based approach to the study of public opinion, the article shows that perception of the seriousness of the problem is positively correlated with high education, post-materialism, and a leftist position on the left-right scale. In addition, religious beliefs are important, suggesting that there is some diversity in the value basis for the issue and that it is not only linked to the 'new-politics' perspective. Variation across nations in wealth and CO2 emissions is not significantly related to the publics' assessments of the problem, and, somewhat counterintuitively, people from countries relatively more exposed to climate-related natural disasters are less concerned about global warming. We suggest possible explanations for the latter finding and discuss our results in relation to the broader literature on environmental change, insecurity, and the potential for conflict.},

	Abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases present a formidable challenge to the conservation of native species in the twenty-first century(1). Diseases caused by introduced pathogens have had large impacts on species abundances(2), including the American chestnut(3), Hawaiian bird species(4) and many amphibians(5). Changes in host population sizes can lead to marked shifts in community composition and ecosystem functioning(3,4,6). However, identifying the impacts of an introduced disease and distinguishing it from other forces that influence population dynamics ( for example, climate(7)) is challenging and requires abundance data that extend before and after the introduction(2,5). Here we use 26 yr of Breeding Bird Survey ( BBS)(8) data to determine the impact of West Nile virus ( WNV) on 20 potential avian hosts across North America. We demonstrate significant changes in population trajectories for seven species from four families that concur with a priori predictions and the spatio-temporal intensity of pathogen transmission. The American crow population declined by up to 45% since WNV arrival, and only two of the seven species with documented impact recovered to pre-WNV levels by 2005. Our findings demonstrate the potential impacts of an invasive species on a diverse faunal assemblage across broad geographical scales, and underscore the complexity of subsequent community response.},

We found geographic gaps in conservation research, with marine, tundra, and desert biomes being studied less than other systems. We also found taxonomic gaps, with amphibians being understudied as compared to other, less threatened, taxonomic groups. Finally, we discovered that studies of invasive species are still lacking, despite the magnitude of the threat they pose to global biodiversity. Although there was a weak trend towards filling these gaps between 1984 and 2004, progress has been slow. To be more effective, the research community must quickly redirect research to better match conservation priorities.},

We examined the types of threats facing species, as well as the degree to which threats were understood and addressed. We found that >85% of all species faced at least four out of nine distinct types of threats. The most common, threats were those related to resource use, exotic species, construction, and the alteration of habitat dynamics. Recovery plans lacked basic information about the magnitude, timing, frequency, or severity of 39% of all threats facing the 181 species. Likewise, 37% of all threats were not directly addressed with recovery tasks. Threats from pollution were more poorly understood than other threats, and threats from exotics were better addressed than other types of threats. Finally, we found that threats that were better understood were assigned recovery tasks more often than threats that were more poorly understood. Thus our results suggest that a lack of basic understanding of the nature of the threats facing threatened and endangered species may, in part, be undermining our recovery efforts.},

	Abstract = {Because data for conservation planning are always limited, surrogates are often substituted for intractable measurements Such as species richness or Population viability. We examined the ability of habitat quality to act as a surrogate for population performance for both Red-shouldered Hawks (Buteo lineatus) and Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). We compared simple measures of habitat quality to estimates of population growth rates obtained from a spatially explicit model of population dynamics. We found that habitat quality was a relatively poor predictor of simulated population growth rates for several reasons. First, a relatively small proportion of the potential habitat for each species served as population sources in Our simulations-15% for Red-shouldered Hawks and 2% for Goshawks. Second, when habitat quality correctly predicted demographic sources on the landscape, it consistently underestimated the contribution of these areas to the population. In areas where habitat quality correctly anticipated the presence of demographic sinks, we found no useful quantitative relationship between the two measures. Our simulation model captured the influence of habitat quality on the hawk populations, but it also incorporated interactions between dispersing individuals and landscape patterns. Thus, the discrepancies we observed likely reflected the influence of forest fragmentation and the spatial arrangement of forest patches on the populations. We conclude that simple measures of habitat quality will often he poor surrogates for population persistence, but that spatially explicit Population models can help inform the development of better indices.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to be one of the greatest drivers of ecological change in the coming century. Increases in temperature over the last century have clearly been linked to shifts in species distributions. Given the magnitude of projected future climatic changes, we can expect even larger range shifts in the coming century. These changes will, in turn, alter ecological communities and the functioning of ecosystems. Despite the seriousness of predicted climate change, the uncertainty in climate-change projections makes it difficult for conservation managers and planners to proactively respond to climate stresses. To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. Eighty percent of the climate projections based on a relatively low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario result in the local loss of at least 10% of the vertebrate fauna over much of North and South America. The largest changes in fauna are predicted for the tundra, Central America, and the Andes Mountains where, assuming no dispersal constraints, specific areas are likely to experience over 90% turnover, so that faunal distributions in the future will bear little resemblance to those of today.},

	Abstract = {Reserves protect biodiversity by ameliorating the threats to the persistence of populations. Methods for efficient, systematic reserve selection have generally been designed to maximize the protection of biodiversity while minimizing the costs of reserves. These techniques have not directly addressed the factors threatening species at specific sites By incorporating measures of site vulnerability into reserve selection procedures, conservation planners can prioritize sites based on both representing biodiversity and the immediacy of factors threatening it. Here we develop two complementary approaches for identifying areas for conservation based on species composition and potential threats facing the species. These approaches build on two established methods of systematic reserve selection. The first approach involves mapping irreplaceability (a statistic derived from reserve selection theory that measures the potential importance of a site for protecting all species) and the degree to which the area is vulnerable to threats from three basic anthropogenic factors (the percentages of a site devoted to agriculture, to urban and suburban development, and to open mines). We classified areas with respect to both irreplaceability and the three indicators of vulnerability, producing a continuous ranking of all sites based on these factors. Our second approach was to incorporate site vulnerability into a reserve selection algorithm. This approach allowed us to locate those sets of sites that protected all species and were most likely to be threatened by human activities. These two analyses can provide regional-scale guidance for conservation in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, and them demonstrate two potential tools for solving complex conservation-planning problems.},

	Abstract = {Predicted changes in the global climate are likely to cause large shifts in the geographic ranges of many plant and animal species. To date, predictions of future range shifts have relied on a variety of modeling approaches with different levels of model accuracy. Using a common data set, we investigated the potential implications of alternative modeling approaches for conclusions about future range shifts and extinctions. Our common data set entailed the current ranges of 100 randomly selected mammal species found in the western hemisphere. Using these range maps, we compared six methods for modeling predicted future ranges. Predicted future distributions differed markedly across the alternative modeling approaches, which in turn resulted in estimates of extinction rates that ranged between 0% and 7%, depending on which model was used. Random forest predictors, a model-averaging approach, consistently outperformed the other techniques (correctly predicting > 99% of current absences and 86% of current presences). We conclude that the types of models used in a study can have dramatic effects on predicted range shifts and extinction rates; and that model-averaging approaches appear to have the greatest potential for predicting range shifts in the face of climate change.},

	Abstract = {Indicators of biodiversity have been proposed as a potential tool for selecting areas for conservation when information about species distributions is scarce. Although tests of the concept have produced varied results, sites selected to address indicator groups can include a high proportion of other species. We tested the hypothesis that species at risk of extinction are not likely to be included in sites selected to protect indicator groups. Using a reserve-selection approach, we compared the ability of seven indicator groups-freshwater fish, birds, mammals, freshwater mussels, reptiles, amphibians, and at-risk species of those six taxa-to provide protection for other species in general and at-risk species in particular in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States. Although sites selected with single taxonomic indicator groups provided protection for between 61% and 82% of all other species, no taxonomic group provided protection for more than 58% of all other at-risk species. The failure to cover at-risk species is likely linked to their rarity. By examining the relationship between a species' probability of coverage by each indicator group and the extent of its geographic range within the study area, we found that species with more restricted ranges were less likely to be protected than more widespread species. Furthermore, we found that although sites selected with indicator groups composed primarily of terrestrial species (birds and mammals) included relatively high percentages of those species (82-85%) they included smaller percentages of strictly aquatic species (27-55%). Finally, of both importance and possible utility, we found that at-risk species themselves performed well as an indicator group, covering an average of 84% of all other species.},

	Abstract = {Given their physiological requirements, limited dispersal abilities, and hydrologically sensitive habitats, amphibians are likely to be highly sensitive to future climatic changes. We used three approaches to map areas in the western hemisphere where amphibians are particularly likely to be affected by climate change. First, we used bioclimatic models to project potential climate-driven shifts in the distribution of 413 amphibian species based on 20 climate simulations for 2071-2100. We summarized these projections to produce estimates of species turnover. Second, we mapped the distribution of 1099 species with restricted geographic ranges. Finally, using the 20 future climate-change simulations, we mapped areas that were consistently projected to receive less seasonal precipitation in the coming century and thus were likely to have altered microclimates and local hydrologies. Species turnover was projected to be highest in the Andes Mountains and parts of Central America and Mexico, where, on average, turnover rates exceeded 60% under the lower of two emissions scenarios. Many of the restricted-range species not included in our range-shift analyses were concentrated in parts of the Andes and Central America and in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Much of Central America, southwestern North America, and parts of South America were consistently projected to experience decreased precipitation by the end of the century. Combining the results of the three analyses highlighted several areas in which amphibians are likely to be significantly affected by climate change for multiple reasons. Portions of southern Central America were simultaneously projected to experience high species turnover, have many additional restricted-range species, and were consistently projected to receive less precipitation. Together, our three analyses form one potential assessment of the geographic vulnerability of amphibians to climate change and as such provide broad-scale guidance for directing conservation efforts.},

	Abstract = {We studied tree regeneration, a key process for the existence of urban woodlands. We hypothesized that, besides the usual biological factors, anthropogenic ones (fragmentation, wear, pollution etc.) determine the regeneration success of tree species in urban woodlands. To test this hypothesis, within an observational setting, we collected data from 30 urban woodlands in the cities of Helsinki and Vantaa, Finland. We defined the number of living saplings (30-200 cm in height) as an indicator of regeneration success and used regression analysis to test different factors as independent variables. The results showed that different tree species responded differently to urban pressure. The regeneration of Picea abies decreased with increasing fragmentation of the forest landscape, whereas for the other most common (deciduous) species, regeneration increased. Wear, measured as total path area per study site, had a negative effect on regeneration success. An a posteriori examination of the data suggested that coarse woody debris might promote regeneration. We conclude that, although tree regeneration in general is not threatened in urban woodlands in the area we studied, the species composition may gradually change. We discuss some management implications for counteracting the urban pressures on tree regeneration.},

Species that have ample intraspecific genetic differentiation, such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), are expected to. display population-specific growth responses to climate change. Using a mixed-effects modeling approach, we describe three-year height. (HT) growth response to changes in climate of interior Douglas-fir populations. We incorporate climate information at the population level, yielding a model that is specific to both species and population. We use data from provenance tests from previous studies that comprised 236 populations from Idaho, Montana, and eastern Washington, USA. The most sensitive indicator of climate was the mean temperature of the coldest month. Population maximum HT and HT growth response to changes in climate were dependent on seed source climate. All populations had optimum HT growth when transferred to climates with warmer winters; those originating in sites with the. warmest winters were taller across sites and had highest HT growth at transfer distances closest to zero; those from colder climates were shortest and had optimum HT growth when transferred the farthest. Although this differential response damped the height growth differences among populations, cold-climate populations still achieved their maximum growth at lower temperatures than warm-climate populations. The results highlight the relevance of understanding climate change impacts at the population level, particularly in a species with ample genetic variation, among populations.},

Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise.},

However, the impacts of climate change on population composition are still poorly documented. Morphotypes are powerful markers to track changes in population composition. In the common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, individuals display two types of dorsal patterns: reticulated (R individuals) and linear (L individuals). We examined how local warming affected intrapopulation frequencies of these morphotypes across 11 years. We observed changes in morph frequency of dorsal patterns across years, paralleling the rise of spring temperatures. The proportion of R individuals increased with June temperatures in juveniles, yearlings, and adult males and females. Three mechanisms could explain these changes: phenotypic plasticity, microevolution and/or dispersal between populations. We investigated the ontogenetic determinism, fitness and recruitment rates associated with dorsal morphotypes. Dorsal pattern ontogeny showed temperature dependence but this relationship was not associated with the warming trend during this study. We found variation by morphotype in survival and clutch size, but these factors did not explain R frequency increases. Among all the parameters considered in this study, only a decrease of immigration, which was more pronounced in the L morphotype, could explain the change in population composition. To our knowledge, this provides the first evidence of the impact of climate warming on population composition due to its effects on immigration.},

However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well-being of both birds and people.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling.

	Abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly finding that complex combinations of competitive and facilitative interactions influence the distribution and abundance of plants. I conducted a two-year field experiment to explore these processes in a streamside community lining the South Fork Eel River in northern California. Specifically, I tested the hypothesis that the sedge Carex nudata provides critical stable substrate for other plants during winter floods and protection from herbivores over the growing season. In addition to these facilitative effects, Carer is also hypothesized to compete with the associated species, and thus limit their size and reproduction. To evaluate these hypotheses, I followed the performance of transplanted individuals of Mimulus guttatus, M. cardinalis, Juncus covillei, Conocephalum conicum, and Brachythecium frigidum and naturally occurring individuals of Epipactis gigantea on Carer tussocks with dense, thinned, pinned back, or completely clipped Carer stems. The five transplanted species were also planted directly onto the emergent streambed. Though streambed transplants grew as well as those on tussocks over the summer, they experienced significantly greater winter mortality, up to 100%, supporting the hypothesis that tussocks provide a critical stable substrate. In contrast, growing season competition by Carer reduced biomass by over 50% for five of the six species and reduced reproductive performance by over 60%. Also, over the growing season, Carex protected M. guttatus and Epipactis from insect larvae and deer, respectively, reducing herbivory by >75%. Additional results from a deer exclosure treatment showed that the positive effects of this "associational defense" were equal in magnitude to the negative effects of Carer competition on Epipactis biomass. The mechanisms underlying these associational defenses and the implications of my results for the relationship between disturbance and facilitation are discussed. I suggest that regarding plant interactions as combinations of facilitative and competitive components may enhance our understanding of natural communities.},

Although theory predicts that these interactions may be common in assemblages of three or more competitors, experimental studies of this process are rare. Here, I report a study of a northern California riparian community, where I tested the hypothesis that the sedge Carex nudata had direct competitive effects on other plant species, as well as indirect facilitative effects, by suppressing a second competitor, the common monkey-flower Mimulus guttatus. Results of a field experiment, in which I manipulated the presence of Cares and M. guttatus in a factorial design, uncovered three qualitatively different interactions between Carer and three target species. I found evidence of indirect facilitation for the liverwort Conocephalum conicum, such that Carex "facilitated" Conocephalum in the presence of M. guttatus, while Carer competed with Conocephalum in the absence of M. guttatus. Plant distribution patterns supported the widespread occurrence of this interaction. Carer also had an indirect positive effect on the scarlet monkey-flower M. cardinalis, though the magnitude of this effect was similar to direct Carex competition. Lastly, Carex had no influence on the moss Brachythecium frigidum. The mechanisms underlying the plant interactions in this study are discussed and incorporated into a general hypothesis that indirect facilitation among competitors is most important in assemblages of species that vary in competitive mechanism.},

Here we explain that despite this concern, experiments manipulating frequency can still effectively quantify the strength of niche differences in stabilizing coexistence, the goal of an experiment we proposed in an earlier paper. Niche differences cause species to have greater per capita growth rates when rare than when common, and we demonstrate that this result is robust to variation in total density. We also emphasize that our proposed experimental design does not call for fixing density across species' frequency gradients, thus differing from a traditional replacement series design. We show that our approach and the more labor-intensive response surface design share the same theoretical foundation and both are apppropriate for quantifying the role of niche differences in stabilizing the dynamics of coexisting species.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists increasingly suspect that climate change will directly impact species physiology. demography, and phenology, but also indirectly affect these measures Via changes to the Surrounding community. Unfortunately, few studies examine both the direct and indirect pathways of impact. Doing so is important because altered competitive pressures can reduce or magnify the direct responses of a focal species to climate change. Here. we examine the effects of changing rainfall on three rare annual plant species in the presence and absence of competition on the California Channel Islands. We used rain-out shelters and hand watering to exclude and augment early, late, and season-long rainfall, spanning the wide range of precipitation change forecast for the region. In the absence of competition, droughts reduced the population growth rates of two of three Cocal annuals, while increased rainfall was only sometimes beneficial. As compared to the focal species, the dominant competitors were more sensitive to the precipitation treatments, benefiting from increased season-long precipitation and harmed by droughts. Importantly, the response of two of three competitors to the precipitation treatments tended to be positively correlated with those of the focal annuals. Although this leads to the expectation that increased competition will counter the direct benefits of favorable conditions, such indirect effects of precipitation change proved weak to nonexistent in our experiment. Competitors had little influence on the precipitation response of two focal species, due to their low sensitivity to competition and highly variable precipitation responses. Competition did affect low our third focal species responded to precipitation change, but this effect only approached significance, and whether it truly resulted from competitor response to precipitation change was unclear. Our work suggests that even, when competitors respond to climate change, these responses may have little effect on the focal species. Ultimately, the strength of the indirect effect depends on how strongly climate change alters competition. and how sensitive focal species are to changes in competition.},

	Abstract = {According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), states have to provide indicators in order to assess the performance of their initiatives for halting the loss of biodiversity. Sixteen headline indicators have been identified for monitoring the CBD targets. Of these indicators only one, "Trends in the abundance and distribution of selected species," is a direct headline indicator of "non-exploited" biodiversity. In France, the implementation of this indicator is completely dependent on data collected by volunteers. Since this investment of volunteer time is equivalent to savings in administrative costs, we attempt in this paper to assign it a monetary value. This enables us to estimate how much the French administration saves thanks to volunteer efforts and how much public funding would have to be invested if volunteers were no longer willing to participate in these biodiversity monitoring schemes. We estimate this amount to be between 678,523 and 4,415,251 euros per year, depending on the scenario selected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Loci with large phenotypic effects are generally not thought to be important in the evolution of quantitative traits because of their deleterious pleiotropic effects, yet empirical studies of such pleiotropic effects are lacking. Here I use molecular markers to test the extent of deleterious pleiotropy of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that have large effects on mating system differences between the wild plants Mimulus guttatus and M. platycalyx (Scrophulariaceae). Six fitness-related traits, namely germination rate (GR), number of nodes (NN), number of flowers (NF), plant height (HT), above-ground biomass (WT), and flowering time (FT) were examined in a growth chamber for a backcross population between M. guttatus and M. platycalyx (with M. platycalyx as recurrent parent). Interval mapping based upon a linkage map consisting of isozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers detected no QTL for fitness-related traits near the mating system QTLs. Single-marker analysis based upon 13 markers flanking the mating system QTLs detected three significant marker-fitness trait associations, and these associations indicate beneficial effects of mating system loci. This suggests that QTLs with large effects on mating system traits do not have significant deleterious pleiotropic effects, and that they could be important factors in adaptive evolution of Mimulus.},

Specifically, we identify, relationships for precipitation and temperature that govern the spatiotemporal variability in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) growth by seeking similarities in patterns of growth/climate models across a significant portion of the climatological range of the species. In the 21(st) century and beyond, sustainable forestry will depend on successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change and climate variability on forest structure and function. The combination of these foci will allow improved prediction of the fate of montane forests over a wide range of biogeoclimatic conditions in western North America and thus allow improved management strategies for adapting to climate change. We describe a multi-disciplinary strategy for analyzing growth variability as a function of climate over a broad range of local-to-regional influences and demonstrate the efficacy of this sampling method in defining regional gradients of growth-limiting factors.},

	Abstract = {The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate(1). As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened(2,3). However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence(4,5). Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr(-1)), derived from spatial gradients (degrees C km(-1)) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (degrees C yr(-1)) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr(-1) (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr(-1)), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr(-1)), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas(6), or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary(7).},

	Abstract = {Identifying the biological determinants of range limits of trees is an unsolved problem of critical importance for predicting the effects of climate change on forests. Data showing that many boreal trees can grow in temperate climates indicate that southern range limits do not necessarily result from excessive temperature per se. A growth tradeoff could exist between freezing tolerance and height growth rate if adaptations to tolerate cold climates interfered with growth. Analysis of height growth rate versus freezing tolerance for twenty-two North American trees provided evidence for such a tradeoff. Provenance trials of numerous tree species also showed that a tradeoff exists within species, indicating a genetic basis for these traits. The result of this tradeoff is that at their southern range margins most species do not suffer from too much heat but rather face competitors with a faster growth rate. The implication for future climate change is that forests will not suffer catastrophic dieback due to increased temperatures but will rather be replaced gradually by faster growing types, perhaps over hundreds of years.},

	Abstract = {While current projections of future climate change associated with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases have a high degree of uncertainty, the potential effects of climate change on forests are of increasing concern. A number of studies based on forest simulation models predict substantial alteration of forest composition, forest dieback, or even loss of forest cover in response to increased temperatures associated with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, the structure of these computer models may cause them to overemphasize the role of climate in controlling tree growth and mortality. Model functions that represent the influence of climate on tree growth are based on the geographic range limits of a species, predicting maximal growth in the center of the range and zero growth (100% mortality) at the range limits and beyond. This modeling approach ignores the fact that the geographic range of a species reflects the influence of both climate and other environmental factors, including competition with other tree species, soil characteristics, barriers to dispersal, and distributions of pests and pathogens. These climate-response functions in forest simulation models implicitly assume that tree species occur in all environments where it is possible for them to survive (their fundamental niche or potential habitat) and that these potential habitats are entirely defined by climate. Hence, any alteration of climate must result in a fairly rapid decline of species near their range limits and rapid alteration of forest composition and structure. The climate-response functions that lead to these unrealistic conclusions have no basis in plant physiology or actual measurements of tree responses to climate stressors. Rather, these functions were chosen as a necessary expedient for modeling the climatic responses of many tree species for which there were limited or no ecophysiological data. There is substantial evidence, however, that some tree species can survive, and even thrive, in climatic conditions outside their present range limits. This evidence suggests that nonclimatic factors exclude some species from natural forests beyond their present range limits and that climate may not be the only determinant of these limits. Hence, there is reason to suspect that published projections of forest responses to climate change based on forest simulation models may exaggerate the direct impact of climate on tree growth and mortality. We propose that forest simulation models be reformulated with more realistic representations of growth responses to temperature, moisture, mortality, and dispersal. We believe that only when these models more accurately reflect the physiological bases of the responses of tree species to climate variables can they be used to simulate responses of forests to rapid changes in climate. We argue that direct forest responses to climate change projected by such a reformulated model may be less traumatic and more gradual than those projected by current models. However, the indirect effects of climate change on forests, mediated by alterations of disturbance regimes or the actions of pests and pathogens, may accelerate climate-induced change in forests, and they deserve further study and inclusion within forest simulation models.},

	Abstract = {1. Tree mortality has important influences on forest structure and composition, but the mechanisms that cause tree mortality are not well understood. Asymmetric competition is known to be a dominant cause of plant mortality, but this idea has not received much attention in studies of long-lived trees. 2. We hypothesised that while tree mortality is dependent on size relative to neighbours as a result of asymmetric competition, tree mortality of shade-tolerant species varies little with size because of their physiological and morphological adaptations to shaded environments. Furthermore, we hypothesised that tree mortality is higher in more crowded stands because of higher average resource competition, in conspecific stands because of potential negative intra-specific interactions, and in older stands because of the physiological limitations and susceptibility to minor disturbances of large trees. 3. Using data from repeatedly measured permanent sampling plots that covered a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in boreal forests, we simultaneously tested, by boosted regression tree models, the effects of an individual's relative size, stand crowding, species interaction and ageing on mortality of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana. 4. Mortality increased strongly with decreasing relative size for all study species, and the size-dependent mortality was stronger for shade-intolerant than for shade-tolerant species. With increasing stand basal area, mortality increased for Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Picea mariana but decreased for Betula papyrifera. Mortality was higher in stands with more conspecific neighbours for Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but was slightly lower for Pinus banksiana. Mortality also increased with stand age for all species. Furthermore, the size-dependent mortality was generally stronger in more crowded stands. 5. Synthesis. Our findings show that tree mortality over a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in non-equilibrium boreal forests was strongly controlled by competition, but species interactions and ageing were also important mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative importance of these mechanisms to tree mortality differed with the shade tolerance of species.},

	Abstract = {We examined stand disturbance history, population structures, spatial relationships of age classes and size classes, and tree growth histories in an old-growth temperate rain forest in southern New Zealand. We aimed to determine the role of juvenile and adult life history differences in promoting coexistence of the four main overstory species (Nothofagus menziesii, Weinmannia racemosa, Dacrydium cupressinum, and Prumnopitys ferruginea). There was no evidence that major compositional shifts were occurring: N. menziesii, D. cupressinum, and P. ferruginea were represented by all-aged populations, indicating continual recruitment of all three species within the 5-ha study area during recent centuries. No age data were obtained for W. racemosa, but the diameter distribution of this species was consistent with an all-aged population structure. The temporal distribution of releases in tree ring sequences suggested a history of chronic patchy disturbance during at least the last 400 years. Ring width sequences were consistent with species differences in growth histories. About half (53%) of N. menziesii >20 cm dbh appeared to have reached the canopy in one growth spurt, compared to only 11% of P. ferruginea. Many trees of the latter species showed multiple episodes of release and suppression, indicating successive responses to several gap events before reaching the canopy. D. cupressinum growth histories were intermediate between these two extremes. Nearest neighbor age relationships also indicated species differences in regeneration patterns. Neighboring individuals of N. menziesii greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh were, on average, significantly more similar in age than random pairs drawn from the age data pool under a bootstrap null model. This pattern is consistent with regeneration of N. menziesii in small, even-aged patches, in response to treefall gaps. In contrast, age differences between nearest neighbor pairs of P. ferruginea and D. cupressinum trees did not deviate significantly from the null model of randomly selected ages, suggesting that establishment and survival were not closely linked to gap formation. Maximum radial growth rates of N. menziesii saplings were nearly 2.5 times those of D. cupressinum and P. ferruginea. Fast growth of N. menziesii beneath treefall gaps may compensate for the greater shade tolerance of P. ferruginea, in particular. D. cupressinum, although apparently outperformed by one or another of its competitors in both shade and treefall gaps, has a longer life-span than any of the other species. Thus, relatively low recruitment rates may be sufficient to maintain its present abundance. Fewer data were available for W. racemosa, but its ability to reproduce vegetatively may be an important factor in its persistence in competition with the other dominants. Under a disturbance regime dominated by treefall gaps, coexistence of the four dominants appears to be associated with complementary differences in growth rate, shade tolerance, canopy residence time, and facility for vegetative reproduction. Our results serve to emphasize that understanding plant species coexistence may require attention to interspecific differences in both juvenile and adult life history characteristics.},

	Abstract = {1. Over the last 30 years there has been a great deal of interest in investigating patterns of species co-occurrence across a number of locations, which has led to the development of numerous methods to determine whether there is evidence that a particular pattern may not have occurred by random chance. 2. A key aspect that seems to have been largely overlooked is the possibility that species may not always be detected at a location when present, which leads to 'false absences' in a species presence/absence matrix that may cause incorrect inferences to be made about co-occurrence patterns. Furthermore, many of the published methods for investigating patterns of species co-occurrence do not account for potential differences in the site characteristics that may partially (at least) explain non-random patterns (e.g. due to species having similar/different habitat preferences). 3. Here we present a statistical method for modelling co-occurrence patterns between species while accounting for imperfect detection and site characteristics. This method requires that multiple presence/absence surveys for the species be conducted over a reasonably short period of time at most sites. The method yields unbiased estimates of probabilities of occurrence, and is practical when the number of species is small (< 4). 4. To illustrate the method we consider data collected on two terrestrial salamander species, Plethodon jordani and members of the Plethodon glutinosus complex, collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. We find no evidence that the species do not occur independently at sites once site elevation has been allowed for, although we find some evidence of a statistical interaction between species in terms of detectability that we suggest may be due to changes in relative abundances.},

	Abstract = {In many parts of the world soils are detrimental to plant growth owing to elevated levels of metal ions, caused either by natural processes or by the result of man's activities. Many plants have evolved ecotypes or varieties that are able to grow more-or-less normally on these soils. This paper reviews our knowledge of the genetics of this phenomenon. The nature of tolerance and the problems of its measurement are discussed. Tolerance is frequently measured by an index produced by comparing growth in a contaminated environment with growth in a control environment. It is argued that this measurement is inappropriate for many genetical studies, and that it is frequently more useful to use growth at a single critical level of metal as a measure of tolerance. Polygenic inheritance provides a null hypothesis that has to be tested in a genetical analysis. Examples of major genes for tolerance to aluminium, arsenic, boron, cadmium, copper and manganese are discussed. Even where major genes have been demonstrated, it is probable that other minor genes, 'modifiers', are present as well. Because of the nature of tolerance as a character, dominance and epistasis are likely to vary with the level of metal at which an analysis is performed. Tolerance is generally found to be dominant at some levels of the metal. Studies which have mapped tolerance genes, particularly to aluminium and salt, are discussed. The specificity of tolerance is a matter of some confusion. Some studies indicate that tolerances evolve independently to different metals, but others have suggested that tolerance to one metal may often confer a degree of tolerance to some other metals. Very little is known about the molecular genetics of tolerance, and the mechanisms of tolerance to most metals. The possible role of phytochelatins and metallothionein-like proteins in metal tolerance is discussed. The distribution of tolerance in natural populations suggests that tolerance is a disadvantage in uncontaminated environments, but how this 'cost' arises is not known. There is some evidence that the disadvantage to tolerance may be associated more with the modifiers of tolerance than with the primary tolerance gene. The study of the genetics of tolerance is of importance in planning breeding programmes to produce tolerant crops for use in areas where metal contamination is a limiting factor in productivity. It can also assist in understanding the mechanisms of tolerance, as exemplified by the study of the mechanism of arsenic tolerance in Holcus lanatus. Important areas for further research are discussed.},

For calculating this value, all components of use and non-use values are estimated and then according to each of them, suitable method has applied. Many different evaluation tools such as contingent valuation method, zonal travel cost method, replacement cost, avoided cost method, value at risk method are used. The semi non parametric distribution free estimator for calculating the contingent valuation method is applied. The probability of willingness to pay the same as the probability of accepting bids is estimated by using data based on questioners approach using stated preference method. The result indicates that the total economic value of this unique ecosystem in Kish Island is at least 14.6 million dollar per year, showing the importance of conservation value of the ecosystem. Its largest component of total economic value is about 62 percent attributed to the recreational value. This is followed by conservation value which is about 23 percent of the economic value. Since coastal protection and waste assimilation functions of coral reef are 10 percent, it is also suitable factor in illustrating total economic value. The economic value for each hectare of this ecosystem in Kish Island is US$ 237,000 in 2009.},

The most widely used definition of plant hardiness zones (United States Department of Agriculture National Arboretum) is based on average annual extreme minimum temperature. There is a need for a global plant hardiness map to standardize the comparison of zones for phytosanitary risk analysis. Two data sets were used to create global hardiness zones: i) Climate Research Unit (CRU) 1973-2002 monthly data set; and ii) the Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). The CRU monthly data set was downscaled to five-minute resolution and a cubic spline was used to convert the monthly values into daily values. The GHCN data were subjected to a number of quality control measures prior to analysis. Least squares regression relationships were developed using GHCN and derived lowest average daily minimum temperature data and average annual extreme minimum temperatures. Error estimate statistics were calculated from the numerical difference between the estimated value for the grid and the station. The mean absolute error for annual extreme minimum temperature was 1.9 degrees C (3.5 degrees F) and 2/3 of the stations were classified into the correct zone.},

	Abstract = {Aim Assessment of cross-continental similarities and differences in climatic limiting values for deciduous tree species and of the possible deterministic influence of past and present climatic differences on the modern tree flora in two regions. Location The deciduous forest regions of western Eurasia and eastern North America. Methods Based on species distribution data (range maps) and climate site data, the realized climatic niches of 137 deciduous tree species from the two regions were quantified using climatic envelopes. To compare these envelopes on the two continents, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed, and principal components analysis was used to check cluster consistency. Results Significant differences do exist for upper limits of winter temperatures and for lower limits of summer temperatures between Western Eurasia and eastern North America. Lower limits for the annual water balance also appear different, suggesting that the deciduous trees may be more drought-tolerant in western Eurasia than in eastern North America. Climatic range types generated by the cluster analysis can be characterized, according to the distribution of the species, as boreal-temperate, northern temperate, temperate, southern temperate, and Appalachian. Five of the eight clusters contain trees from both regions, but three groups consist only of American species that have no European counterparts. Main conclusions Differences in temperature limitations can be explained by location on the east versus west side of the continents and by the almost complete lack of warm moist areas in western Eurasia. The difference in drought tolerance, on the other hand, is more likely to be the product of a deterministic sorting process that occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene.},

For this study we evaluated vitality, radial growth and reproductive efficiency in Polylepis australis (Rosaceae) throughout its complete altitudinal range in central Argentina. We selected seven forest fragments ranging from 900 to 2700 m a.s.l. In the field, we subjectively assigned vitality and seed productivity indexes to 12 P. australis trees per fragment. In addition, we cored and assessed for radial growth 10-18 trees per altitudinal level. In the laboratory, we individually weighed seeds from four or five trees from each altitudinal level and divided into two seed mass classes (light and heavy). We then tested for germination and monitored their seedlings for survival. Seedlings of three trees per altitudinal level were harvested after 40 days and assessed for dry mass. Seedlings of one to two trees per altitudinal level were monitored for survival until both leaves and roots had died. Our main results showed two types of responses to altitude: a unimodal relationship with an optimum at intermediate altitudes of around 1800 m a.s.l. for tree vitality, radial growth, seed productivity and seed mass; and an increase with altitude for in-vitro seed germination and seedling survival. A rise in temperature due to climate change could restrict P. australis to the upper most altitudes, where conservation of these forests will be a priority.},

	Abstract = {Plants are attacked by many different consumers. A critical question is how often, and under what conditions, common reductions in growth, fecundity or even survival that occur due to herbivory translate to meaningful impacts on abundance, distribution or dynamics of plant populations. Here, we review population-level studies of the effects of consumers on plant dynamics and evaluate: (i) whether particular consumers have predictably more or less influence on plant abundance, (ii) whether particular plant life-history types are predictably more vulnerable to herbivory at the population level, (iii) whether the strength of plant-consumer interactions shifts predictably across environmental gradients and (iv) the role of consumers in influencing plant distributional limits. Existing studies demonstrate numerous examples of consumers limiting local plant abundance and distribution. We found larger effects of consumers on grassland than woodland forbs, stronger effects of herbivory in areas with high versus low disturbance, but no systematic or unambiguous differences in the impact of consumers based on plant life-history or herbivore feeding mode. However, our ability to evaluate these and other patterns is limited by the small (but growing) number of studies in this area. As an impetus for further study, we review strengths and challenges of population-level studies, such as interpreting net impacts of consumers in the presence of density dependence and seed bank dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Speciation often involves the evolution of numerous prezygotic and postzygotic isolating barriers between divergent populations. Detailed knowledge of the strength and nature of those barriers provides insight into ecological and genetic factors that directly or indirectly influenced their origin, and may help predict whether they will be maintained in the face of sympatric hybridization and introgression. We estimated the magnitude of pre- and postzygotic barriers between naturally occurring sympatric populations of Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. Prezygotic barriers, including divergent flowering phenologies, differential pollen production, mating system isolation, and conspecific pollen precedence, act asymmetrically to completely prevent the formation of F, hybrids among seeds produced by M. guttatus (Fig), and reduce F, hybrid production among seeds produced by M. nasutus (Fin) to only about 1%. Postzygotic isolation is also asymmetric: in field experiments, Fig but not Fin hybrids had significantly reduced germination rates and survivorship compared to parental species. Both hybrid classes had flower, pollen, and seed production values within the range of parental values. Despite the moderate degree of Fig hybrid inviability, postzygotic isolation contributes very little to the total isolation between these species in the wild. We also found that F, hybrid flowering phenology overlapped more with M. guttatus than M. nasutus. These results, taken together, suggest greater potential for introgression from M. nasutus to M. guttatus than for the reverse direction. We also address problems with commonly used indices of isolation, discuss difficulties in calculating meaningful measures of reproductive isolation when barriers are asymmetric, and propose novel measures of prezygotic isolation that are consistent with postzygotic measures.},

	Abstract = {The increase in diversity towards the equator arises from latitudinal variation in rates of cladogenesis, extinction, immigration and/or emigration of taxa. We tested the relative contribution of all four processes to the latitudinal gradient in 26 marine invertebrate orders with extensive fossil records, examined previously by David Jablonski. Coupling Jablonski's estimates of latitudinal variation in cladogenesis with new data on patterns of extinction and current distributions, we show that the present-day gradient in diversity is caused by higher rates of cladogenesis and subsequent range expansion (immigration) at lower latitudes. In contrast, extinction and emigration were not important in the creation of the latitudinal gradient in ordinal richness. This work represents one of the first simultaneous tests of the role of all four processes in the creation of the latitudinal gradient in taxonomic richness, and suggests that low tropical extinction rates are not essential to the creation of latitudinal diversity gradients.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of evolution are believed to vary latitudinally, but our understanding of this variation remains limited. Here we examine how patterns of subspecific diversification vary within species of birds, specifically addressing three questions: (1) Are subspecies more numerous at lower latitudes within species, consistent with greater phenotypic differentiation at lower latitudes ? (2) If there are more subspecies at lower latitudes within species, can area of breeding range explain this relationship ? and (3) how do latitudinal differences in subspecies within species vary geographically across the globe ? Using all species with five or more subspecies from 12 of the most diverse families of birds in the world, we found consistently more subspecies at lower latitudes across all families, both hemispheres, and all continents examined. Despite the positive influence of area on the number of subspecies within species, area did not explain the greater number of subspecies at lower latitudes within species. Global patterns of subspecies support the idea that phenotypic differentiation of populations is greater at lower latitudes within species. If subspecies density provides an index of rates of incipient speciation, then our results support evolutionary hypotheses for the latitudinal diversity gradient that invoke higher tropical speciation rates.},

	Abstract = {We measured whole-tree sap flow in a 43-year-old Abies amabilis (Dougl. ex Loud.) Dougl. ex J. Forbes - Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. forest in western Washington, U.S.A. We calculated whole tree crown conductance to water vapor (g(crown)) by substituting the sap flow data and meteorological measurements into the inverted Penman-Monteith equation. Individual tree sap flow and crown conductance varied widely with tree size, with the smallest tree sampled having average g(crown) (on a ground-area basis) of 0.57 mm.s(-1) and transpiring up to 4.9 kg.day(-1), while the largest tree measured had an average g(crown) of 7.20 mm.s(-1) and lost as much as 98 kg.day(-1). Crown conductance responded linearly and positively to radiation, and had a negative exponential response to vapor pressure deficit. These response patterns were utilized to construct an empirical model of g(crown) that explained from 52 to 73% (average 66%) of the variation in g(crown). The dominant and codominant trees in the stand transpired for longer periods during the day than trees in the smaller size classes, and contributed disproportionately to total stand transpiration. Daily total sap flow for individual trees was strongly correlated with tree basal area; we used the relationship between these variables to estimate daily stand transpiration. Stand transpiration calculated for 28 days between August 6 and October 12, 1993, ranged from 0.01 to 3.52 mm.day(-1). Stand transpiration increased curvilinearly with increasing average daily vapor pressure deficit, reflecting the negative response of g(crown) to vapor pressure deficit.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is now considered the greatest long-term threat to coral reefs, with some future change inevitable despite mitigation efforts. Managers must therefore focus on supporting the natural resilience of reefs, requiring that resilient reefs and reef regions be identified. We develop a framework for assessing resilience and trial it by applying the framework to target management responses to climate change on the southern Great Barrier Reef. The framework generates a resilience score for a site based on the evaluation of 19 differentially weighted indicators known or thought to confer resilience to coral reefs. Scores are summed, and sites within a region are ranked in terms of (1) their resilience relative to the other sites being assessed, and (2) the extent to which managers can influence their resilience. The framework was applied to 31 sites in Keppel Bay of the southern Great Barrier Reef, which has a long history of disturbance and recovery. Resilience and 'management influence potential' were both found to vary widely in Keppel Bay, informing site selection for the staged implementation of resilience-based management strategies. The assessment framework represents a step towards making the concept of resilience operational to reef managers and conservationists. Also, it is customisable, easy to teach and implement and effective in building support among local communities and stakeholders for management responses to climate change.},

	Abstract = {Scientific advice to fishery managers needs to be expressed in probabilistic terms to convey uncertainty about the consequences of alternative harvesting policies (policy performance indices). In most Bayesian approaches to such advice, relatively few of the model parameters used can be treated as uncertain, and deterministic assumptions about population dynamics are required; this can bias the degree of certainty and estimates of policy performance indices. We reformulate a Bayesian approach that uses the sampling/importance resampling algorithm to improve estimates of policy performance indices; it extends the number of parameters that can be treated as uncertain, does not require deterministic assumptions about population dynamics, and can use any of the types of fishery assessment models and data. Application of the approach to New Zealand's western stock of hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) shows that the use of Bayesian prior information for parameters such as the constant of proportionality for acoustic survey abundance indices can enhance management advice by reducing uncertainty in current stock size estimates; it also suggests that assuming historic recruitment is deterministic can create large negative biases (e.g., 26%) in estimates of biological and economic risks of alternative harvesting policies and that a stochastic recruitment assumption can be more appropriate.},

	Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management. Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.},

However, if climate change proceeds as predicted, stock that is well matched under current climate will be growing in sub-optimal conditions within the next 20 to 50 years-in some parts of the country, trees may already be growing outside their optimal climates. To provide a sense of the magnitude of these changes, we present past and predicted future climate trends for Ontario and British Columbia seed zones. For Ontario, over the period 1950 to 2005, minimum temperature of the coldest month has already increased by up to 4.3 degrees C, growing season has lengthened by up to 6 days, and precipitation during the growing season has increased by up to 26%. Changes were more pronounced across British Columbia's Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) seed zones, with minimum temperature increasing by up to 8 C, a growing season extension of up to 30 days, and growing season precipitation increases of up to 40%. Projections for the end of the current century include: minimum temperature increase of 5 degrees C to 10 degrees C, growing season extension of 31 to 60 days, and growing season precipitation increases of 3% to 42% across the seed zones in both provinces. These changes are certain to have extensive impacts on forest ecosystems. We briefly discuss 3 forest management adaptation strategies intended to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in Canada.},

	Abstract = {Climatic variability is a dominant factor affecting large wildfires in the western United States, an observation supported by palaeoecological data on charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced. The effects of climatic change will partially depend on the extent to which resource management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.},

	Abstract = {We explored spatial patterns of low-frequency variability in radial tree growth among western North American conifer species and identified predictors of the variability in these patterns. Using 185 sites from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank, each of which contained 10-60 raw ring-width series, we rebuilt two chronologies for each site, using two conservative methods designed to retain any low-frequency variability associated with recent environmental change. We used factor analysis to identify regional low-frequency patterns in site chronologies and estimated the slope of the growth trend since 1850 at each site from a combination of linear regression and time-series techniques. This slope was the response variable in a regression-tree model to predict the effects of environmental gradients and species-level differences on growth trends. Growth patterns at 27 sites from the American Southwest were consistent with quasi-periodic patterns of drought. Either 12 or 32 of the 185 sites demonstrated patterns of increasing growth between 1850 and 1980 A.D., depending on the standardization technique used. Pronounced growth increases were associated with high-elevation sites (above 3000 m) and high-latitude sites in maritime climates. Future research focused on these high-elevation and high-latitude sites should address the precise mechanisms responsible for increased 20th century growth.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the effects of climatic change on mountain forests, where snowpacks and short growing seasons limit tree establishment and growth, is a key concern for both ecologists and foresters. We quantified associations between climatic and biophysical variables and individual conifer species distributions in mountain forests with generalized linear models. For the majority of species, a unimodal response to moisture and temperature gradients was evident, suggesting that an environmental niche can be identified. Species known to respond to limiting factors in the abiotic environment showed the strongest associations with predictor variables. The models can improve forecasts of the potential redistribution of species on the landscape in response to climatic change, but disturbance, migration rates. and limits on regeneration are important sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, by identifying climate-based niches of different species, we can identify effective strategies for reforestation and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes.},

	Abstract = {Anticipating species movement under climate change is a major focus in conservation. Bioclimate models are one of the few predictive tools for adaptation planning, but are limited in accounting for (i) climatic tolerances in preadult life stages that are potentially more vulnerable to warming; and (ii) local-scale movement and use of climatic refugia as an alternative or complement to large-scale changes in distribution. To assess whether these shortfalls can be addressed with field demographic data, we used California valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee), a long-lived species with juvenile life stages known to be sensitive to climate. We hypothesized that the valley oak bioclimate model, based on adults, would overpredict the species' ability to remain in the projected persisting area, due to higher climate vulnerability of young life stages; and underpredict the potential for the species to remain in the projected contracting area in local-scale refugia. We assessed the bioclimate model projections against actual demographic patterns in natural populations. We found that saplings were more constricted around surface water than adults in the projected contracting area. We also found that the climate envelope for saplings is narrower than that for adults. Saplings disappeared at a summer maximum temperature 3 similar to degrees C below that associated with adults. Our findings indicate that rather than a complete shift northward and upward, as predicted by the species bioclimate model, valley oaks are more likely to experience constriction around water bodies, and eventual disappearance from areas exceeding a threshold of maximum temperature. Ours is the first study we know of to examine the importance of discrete life stage climate sensitivities in determining bioclimate modeling inputs, and to identify current climate change-related constriction of a species around microrefugia. Our findings illustrate that targeted biological fieldwork can be central to understanding climate change-related movement for long-lived, sessile species.},

	Abstract = {We assess the significance of high-frequency variability of environmental parameters (sunlight, precipitation, temperature) for the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems under current and future climate. We examine the influence of hourly, daily, and monthly variance using the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 in conjunction with the long-term record of carbon fluxes measured at Harvard Forest. We find that fluctuations of sunlight and precipitation are strongly and nonlinearly coupled to ecosystem function, with effects that accumulate through annual and decadal timescales. Increasing variability in sunlight and precipitation leads to lower rates of carbon sequestration and favors broad-leaved deciduous trees over conifers. Temperature variability has only minor impacts by comparison. We also find that projected changes in sunlight and precipitation variability have important implications for carbon storage and ecosystem structure and composition. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model estimates for changes in high-frequency meteorological variability over the next 100 years, we expect that terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in variability almost as much as by changes in mean climate. We conclude that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to high-frequency meteorological variability, and that accurate knowledge of the statistics of this variability is essential for realistic predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.},

	Abstract = {Aim Species ranges have adapted during the Holocene to altering climate conditions, but it remains unclear if species will be able to keep pace with recent and future climate change. The goal of our study is to assess the influence of changing macroclimate, competition and habitat connectivity on the migration rates of 14 tree species. We also compare the projections of range shifts from species distribution models (SDMs) that incorporate realistic migration rates with classical models that assume no or unlimited migration. Location Europe. Methods We calibrated SDMs with species abundance data from 5768 forest plots from ICP Forest Level 1 in relation to climate, topography, soil and land-use data to predict current and future tree distributions. To predict future species ranges from these models, we applied three migration scenarios: no migration, unlimited migration and realistic migration. The migration rates for the SDMs incorporating realistic migration were estimated according to macroclimate, interspecific competition and habitat connectivity from simulation experiments with a spatially explicit process model (TreeMig). From these relationships, we then developed a migration cost surface to constrain the predicted distributions of the SDMs. Results The distributions of early-successional species during the 21st century predicted by SDMs that incorporate realistic migration matched quite well with the unlimited migration assumption (mean migration rate over Europe for A1fi/GRAS climate and land-use change scenario 156.7 +/- 79.1 m year(-1) and for B1/SEDG 164.3 +/- 84.2 m year(-1)). The predicted distributions of mid-to late-successional species matched better with the no migration assumption (A1fi/GRAS, 15.2 +/- 24.5 m year(-1) and B1/SEDG, 16.0 +/- 25.6 m year(-1)). Inter-specific competition, which is higher under favourable growing conditions, reduced range shift velocity more than did adverse macroclimatic conditions (i.e. very cold or dry climate). Habitat fragmentation also led to considerable time lags in range shifts. Main conclusions Migration rates depend on species traits, competition, spatial habitat configuration and climatic conditions. As a result, re-adjustments of species ranges to climate and land-use change are complex and very individualistic, yet still quite predictable. Early-successional species track climate change almost instantaneously while mid-to late-successional species were predicted to migrate very slowly.},

	Abstract = {Local land-use policy is increasingly being recognized as fundamental to biodiversity conservation in the United States. Many planners and conservation scientists have called for broader use of planning and regulatory tools to support the conservation of biodiversity at local scales. Yet little is known about the pervasiveness of these practices. We conducted an on-line survey of county, municipal, and tribal planning directors (n = 116) in 3 geographic regions of the United States: metropolitan Seattle, Washington; metropolitan Des Moines, Iowa; and the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our objectives were to gauge the extent to which local planning departments address biodiversity conservation and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder conservation actions in local planning. We found that biodiversity conservation was seldom a major consideration in these departments. Staff time was mainly devoted to development mandates and little time was spent on biodiversity conservation. Regulations requiring conservation actions that might benefit biodiversity were uncommon, with the exception of rules governing water quality in all 3 regions and the protection of threatened and endangered species in the Seattle region. Planning tools that could enhance habitat conservation were used infrequently. Collaboration across jurisdictions was widespread, but rarely focused on conservation. Departments with a conservation specialist on staff tended to be associated with higher levels of conservation actions. Jurisdictions in the Seattle region also reported higher levels of conservation action, largely driven by state and federal mandates.

	Abstract = {Climate change is altering the phenology of species across the world, but what are the consequences of these phenological changes for the demography and population dynamics of species? Time-sensitive relationships, such as migration, breeding and predation, may be disrupted or altered, which may in turn alter the rates of reproduction and survival, leading some populations to decline and others to increase in abundance. However, finding evidence for disrupted relationships, or lack thereof, and their demographic effects, is difficult because the necessary detailed observational data are rare. Moreover, we do not know how sensitive species will generally be to phenological mismatches when they occur. Existing long-term studies provide preliminary data for analysing the phenology and demography of species in several locations. In many instances, though, observational protocols may need to be optimized to characterize timing-based multi-trophic interactions. As a basis for future research, we outline some of the key questions and approaches to improving our understanding of the relationships among phenology, demography and climate in a multi-trophic context. There are many challenges associated with this line of research, not the least of which is the need for detailed, long-term data on many organisms in a single system. However, we identify key questions that can be addressed with data that already exist and propose approaches that could guide future research.},

	Abstract = {1. First flowering dates are occurring earlier than they did in the past in many locations around the world. It is sometimes assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that the changes in first flowering dates describe the phenological behaviour of entire populations. However, first flowering dates represent one extreme of the flowering distribution and may be susceptible to undesirable confounding effects. 2. We used observations of flowering in Colorado and Massachusetts to test whether changes in population size and sampling frequency affect observations of first flowering dates. 3. We found that the effect of population size on first flowering dates depended on location. Changes in population size were strongly related to the dates on which first flowering was observed in Massachusetts but not in Colorado. The lack of a significant effect in Colorado may reflect the rapid onset of spring after snowmelt and fixed developmental schedules of the plants at this sub-alpine site, or the scale of the plots sampled during the study. 4. We also found that changes in sampling frequency can influence observed changes in first flowering dates and other aspects of the flowering distribution. Similar to the effect of declines in population size, lower sampling frequency caused later observations of first flowering. However, lower sampling frequency, if maintained consistently throughout a study, did not significantly affect estimates of changes in flowering dates over time or in response to climate. 5. Synthesis. Researchers should consider the effects of changes in population size and sampling frequency when interpreting changes in first flowering dates. In some cases, past results may need to be reinterpreted. When possible, researchers should observe the entire flowering distribution or consider tracking peak or mean flowering dates to avoid the confounding effects of population size and sampling frequency.},

	Abstract = {Past studies of bird migration times have shown great variation in migratory responses to climate change. We used 33 years of bird capture data (1970-2002) from Manomet, Massachusetts to examine variation in spring migration times for 32 species of North American passerines. We found that changes in first arrival dates - the unit of observation used in most studies of bird migration times - often differ dramatically from changes in the mean arrival date of the migration cohort as a whole. In our study, the earliest recorded springtime arrival date for each species occurred 0.20 days later each decade. In contrast, the mean arrival dates for birds of each species occurred 0.78 days earlier each decade. The difference in the two trends was largely explained by declining migration cohort sizes, a factor not examined in many previous studies. We found that changes in migration cohort or population sizes may account for a substantial amount of the variation in previously documented changes in migration times. After controlling for changes in migration cohort size, we found that climate variables, migration distance, and date of migration explained portions of the variation in migratory changes over time. In particular, short-distance migrants appeared to respond to changes in temperature, while mid-distance migrants responded particularly strongly to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index. The migration times of long-distance migrants tended not to change over time. Our findings suggest that previously reported changes in migration times may need to be reinterpreted to incorporate changes in migration cohort sizes.},

	Abstract = {As a result of climate change, many plants are now flowering measurably earlier than they did in the past. However, some species' flowering times have changed much more than others. Data at the community level can clarify the variation in flowering responses to climate change. In order to determine how North American species' flowering times respond to climate, we analyzed a series of previously unstudied records of the dates of first flowering for over 500 plant taxa in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. These records began with six years of observations by the famous naturalist Henry David Thoreau from 1852 to 1858, continued with 16 years of observations by the botanist Alfred Hosmer in 1878 and 1888 - 1902, and concluded with our own observations in 2004, 2005, and 2006. From 1852 through 2006, Concord warmed by 2.4 degrees C due to global climate change and urbanization. Using a subset of 43 common species, we determined that plants are now flowering seven days earlier on average than they did in Thoreau's times. Plant flowering times were most correlated with mean temperatures in the one or two months just before flowering and were also correlated with January temperatures. Summer-flowering species showed more interannual variation in flowering time than did spring-flowering species, but the flowering times of spring-flowering species correlated more strongly to mean monthly temperatures. In many cases, such as within the genera Betula and Solidago, closely related, co-occurring species responded to climate very differently from one another. The differences in flowering responses to warming could affect relationships in plant communities as warming continues. Common St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) are particularly responsive to changes in climate, are common across much of the United States, and could serve as indicators of biological responses to climate change. We discuss the need for researchers to be aware, when using data sets involving multiple observers, of how varying methodologies, sample sizes, and sampling intensities affect the results. Finally, we emphasize the importance of using historical observations, like those of Thoreau and Hosmer, as sources of long-term data and to increase public awareness of biological responses to climate change.},

Of the biological responses to warming, changes in the timing of phenological events such as flowering are among the most sensitive. Despite the recognized importance of phenological changes, the limited number of long-term records of phenological events has restricted research on the topic in most areas of the world. In a previous study in Boston (American Journal of Botany 91: 1260-1264), we used herbarium specimens and one season of field observations to show that plants flowered earlier as the climate warmed over the past 100 yr. In our new study, we found that two extra years of data did not strengthen the explanatory power of the analysis. Analysis of herbarium specimens without any field data yielded results similar to analyses that included field observations. In addition, we found that photographs of cultivated and wild plants in Massachusetts, data similar to that contained in herbarium specimens, show changes in flowering times that closely match independent data on the same species in the same locations. Dated photographs of plants in flower represent a new resource to extend the range of species and localities addressed in global-warming research.},

However, it is not clear whether researchers can successfully use different sources of data to compare changes in migration times. We examined 25 years of changes in migration times for 30 species of birds at Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as documented by bird-club members and published in a regional bird journal. We found that, overall, birds arrived, earlier in warmer springs in eastern Massachusetts. We compared our findings With those of previous studies in Massachusetts, which included data from a standardized bird-banding station and observations from a naturalist's journal and bird-club records. On a species-by-species basis, changes in migration times were not correlated among the Studies. We believe that local changes in Population sizes and sampling effort at some of the sites may have contributed to the lack of correlation. For the Purpose of comparing changes in migration time,,, across species and locations, standardized bird-banding data are preferable to data collected by volunteer naturalists.

We investigated whether stomatal density, guard cell length, and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of 27 individual trees growing at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. Massachusetts have responded to changing environmental conditions over the last 100 years. We examined leaves from 74 herbarium specimens collected from three genera-Acer (maples), Quercus (oaks), and Carpinus (hornbeams)-from 1893 to 2006. During this period, global average atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by approximately 29% (86 ppm), and temperatures in Boston increased by 1.8 degrees C. Stomatal density and guard cell length were negatively correlated in oaks and hombeams. Although stomatal density declined and guard cell length increased over time, the changes were not dependent on the magnitude of changes in CO2 concentrations. Intrinsic WUE did not change significantly over time. Our findings suggest that iWUE may not respond to changes in CO2 concentrations over the lifetimes of individual trees, possibly because of compensating changes in stomatal density and guard cell size. We provide an example of a method that can enable researchers to differentiate between genetic and plastic responses to global change in long-lived trees.},

	Abstract = {Mutualisms are well known to influence individual fitness and the population dynamics of partner species, but little is known about whether they influence species distributions and the location of geographic range limits. Here, we examine the contribution of plant-pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators. Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance. Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations. Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system.},

	Abstract = {Stem-mapped plots in old-growth forests of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) in northern Idaho, USA were analyzed using Ripley's K(d) function, nearest-neighbor function, and influence zone analyses. A conceptual model of old-growth forest development was formulated from the spatial pattern analyses, to guide the development of a mathematical model. In the conceptual model, cohorts of seedlings begin life established in clusters associated with canopy gaps created by the deaths of overstory trees. Then, as the trees within clusters increase in size, they begin to compete with their immediate neighbors. Density-dependent mortality thins the clusters and increases the distance between neighboring trees. Over time, this self-thinning behavior tends to drive stand spatial patterns from aggregation towards regular spacing as trees get larger or increase in competitive status. Preliminary results from a dynamic point process model are presented. The approach simulates the regeneration of seedlings in gaps and the dynamic spatial patterns resulting from competitive interactions between neighboring trees as a sequence of point processes. Main features of the model are stochastic assignment of gapmaker trees, a Poisson cluster process for regeneration establishment, and a progressive simple inhibition process for competition between neighboring trees. The model produces spatial patterns for regeneration and adult trees consistent with the conceptual model and with patterns observed in the field data. Refinements designed to improve model realism are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

To this end, a ring-width chronology from 25 cores from a stand of seven Dahurian larch trees growing in the Secrest Arboretum, northeastern Ohio, was developed to test the climatic sensitivity of the species in a more temperate climate. The chronology extends from 1931 to 2005 and correlation analysis with monthly precipitation and temperature records shows growth was most strongly limited by summer precipitation until recent decades when sensitivity has shifted to late spring precipitation. The results from this study serve as a contemporary analog to the future growth response of Dahurian larch under warmer and wetter growing conditions in the boreal and arctic regions of Eurasia.},

	Abstract = {1. The theory of sexual resource allocation in plants assumes (a) that trade-offs occur between the resources allocated to male, female and attractive structures, and (b) that genetic variation occurs, or has occurred, within populations upon which natural selection could act to optimize the relative investment in each structure. These assumptions were tested in a study of 10 clones of Mimulus guttatus isolated from a natural population, which varied in the proportion of viable pollen they produced. The experiment was designed to investigate whether plants which invest less in viable pollen can reallocate the resources released to other functions within the same or subsequent flowers or fruits. 2. This study has failed to find any significant difference in other floral characters associated with the variation in pollen quality. Plants producing less pollen do not produce bigger or more numerous flowers, do not invest more in female function (ovaries or fruits), and do not differ in the rate at which flowers and floral components decline in size as the plants age. 3. These results suggest therefore that trade-offs between male and female function do not occur, or at least are not inevitable. There is evidence for a trade-off between primary sexual characters and attractive structures, and between the size of flowers and the rate at which flowers declined in size with time. This indicates that early investment in large flowers may be costly. 4. Pollen-ovule ratios decline with time and size of flower. Most of the floral characters studied were significantly correlated with flower size, but even when this correlation was removed by analysis of covariance, significant genetic variation could still be detected for most characters. This indicates that selection could act to alter the relative contribution of the different components of the flower if it should be advantageous.},

	Abstract = {Low Ca/Mg ratios (a defining component of serpentine soils) and low water environmental conditions often co-occur in nature and are thought to exert strong selection pressures on natural populations. However, few studies test the individual and combined effects of these environmental factors. We investigated the effects of low Ca/Mg ratio and low water availability on plant leaf, stem, stolon, and floral traits of Mimulus guttatus, a bodenvag species, i.e., a species that occurs in serpentine and non-serpentine areas. We quantified genetic variation and genetic variation for plasticity for these leaf, stem, stolon, and floral traits at three hierarchical levels: field-habitat type, population, and family, and we evaluated the relative importance of local adaptation and plasticity. We chose two populations and 10 families per population from four distinct field "habitat types" in northern California: high Ca/Mg ratio (non-serpentine) and season-long water availability, high Ca/Mg ratio and seasonally drying, low Ca/Mg ratio (serpentine) and season-long water availability, and low Ca/Mg ratio and seasonally drying. Seedlings were planted into greenhouse treatments that mimicked the four field conditions. We only detected genetic variation for stem diameter and length of longest leaf at the field-habitat level, but we detected genetic variation at the family level for nearly all traits. Soil chemistry and water availability had strong phenotypic effects, alone and in combination. Our hypothesis of an association between responses to low water levels and low Ca/Mg ratio was upheld for length of longest leaf, stem diameter, corolla width, and total number of reproductive units, whereas for other traits, responses to Ca/Mg ratio and low water were clearly independent. Our results suggest that traits may evolve independently from Ca/Mg ratios and water availability and that our focal traits were not simple alternative measures of vigor. We found genetic variation for plasticity both at the field-habitat type and family levels for half of the traits studied. Phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation for plasticity appear to be more important than local adaptation in the success of these M. guttatus populations found across a heterogeneous landscape in northern California. Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism maintaining the broad ecological breadth of native populations of M. guttatus.},

	Abstract = {For many Pacific Northwest forests, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability in tree growth climate relationships, yet it is this information that is needed to predict how forests will respond to future climatic change. We studied the effects of climatic variability on forest growth at 74 plots in the western and northeastern Olympic Mountains. Basal area increment time series were developed for each plot, and Pearson's correlation analysis and factor analysis were used to quantify growth-climate relationships. Forest growth in the Olympic Mountains responds to climatic variability as a function of mean climate and elevation. Low summer moisture limits growth across all elevations in the dry northeastern Olympics. Growth at low elevations in the wet western Olympics is associated with phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and with summer temperature. Heavy winter snowpack limits growth at high elevations in the western Olympics. In the warmer greenhouse climate predicted for the Olympic Mountains, productivity at high elevations of the western Olympics will likely increase, whereas productivity at high elevations in the northeastern region and potentially in low elevations of the western region will likely decrease. This information can be used to develop adaptive management strategies to prepare for the effects of future climate on these forests. Because growth-climate relationships on the Olympic Peninsula vary at relatively small spatial scales, those relationships may assist modeling and other efforts to provide more accurate predictions at local to regional scales.},

Using data from the Willamette Basin, Oregon, we compare the provision of carbon sequestration and species conservation under five simple policies that offer payments for conservation. We evaluate policy performance compared with the maximum feasible combinations of carbon sequestration and species conservation on the landscape for various conservation budgets. None of the conservation payment policies produce increases in carbon sequestration and species conservation that approach the maximum potential gains on the landscape. Our results show that policies aimed at increasing the provision of carbon sequestration do not necessarily increase species conservation and that highly targeted policies do not necessarily do as well as more general policies.},

Much has been written about advocacy by scientists, and that literature describes substantial diversity in reasons why advocacy by scientists is or is not appropriate. Despite the nature of this literature there has been no comprehensive, systematic review of why some favor and others oppose advocacy by environmental scientists. Through a literature review we catalogued, categorized, and critiqued the arguments used for and against the appropriateness of advocacy by environmental scientists. Most arguments, whether for or against advocacy, are characterized by some significant deficiency. From our analysis of the literature an argument emerges that to date has never been fully articulated: that advocacy is nearly unavoidable, and that scientists, by virtue of being citizens first and scientists second, have a responsibility to advocate to the best of their abilities, to improve their advocacy abilities, and to advocate in a justified and transparent manner. We also discuss the meaning and relevance of advocacy being justified and transparent. We suggest scientists expend their efforts to better understand what constitutes appropriate advocacy and spend less effort pondering whether they should advocate.},

This review advances our knowledge in these areas by drawing together urban fungal studies along with relevant broader research on both fungal and urban ecology. From these studies we discuss the ecological roles of fungi, such as their beneficial interactions with plants and animals. We also highlight the ecological processes that could potentially threaten the persistence of fungi in cities. Among these are the dangers of soil pollution and changes to the biota that form relationships with fungi. We conclude by suggesting some ways forward for research in this area, as well as considering the potential for fungal conservation in cities if their ecology can be understood and communicated to land managers.

This data-driven approach requires the organization of large amounts of ecological data, analysis of these data to discover complex patterns, and subsequent development of hypotheses corresponding to detected patterns. This proposed new approach has been contrasted with more-traditional knowledge-based approaches in which investigators deduce consequences of competing hypotheses to be confronted with actual data, providing a basis for discriminating among the hypotheses. We note that one approach is directed at hypothesis generation, whereas the other is also focused on discriminating among competing hypotheses. Here, we argue for the importance of using existing knowledge to the separate issues of (a) hypothesis selection and generation and (b) hypothesis discrimination and testing. In times of limited conservation funding, the relative efficiency of different approaches to learning should be an important consideration in decisions about how to study biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {Cypripedium calceolus L. is an emblematic long-lived clonal orchid which has suffered an alarming decline throughout Eurasia. We performed a population viability analysis on three island populations in a protected area to estimate population viability and thus to gain a better understanding of the species and its needs. We developed a 10-stage matrix model, comprising the seed bank, the first 4 years underground, juveniles, young and adult clump stages and three dormant stages, from an 11-year census. All analyses indicate that the three populations have remarkably slow and stable dynamics, with stochastic growth rates close to 1 after 100 years and very slow convergence to equilibrium. The system is probably stabilized by the long life span of clumps (mean longevity from 110 to 350 years). Retrospective and perturbation analyses showed that adult dormancy had an important role in the dynamics, and adult survival and seed persistence were key factors in maintaining population stability and persistence. A young, uniformly distributed population had fewer, shorter lived adult clumps than two older, aggregated populations. Although no perceptible change was predicted for the next 100 years, the younger population was more sensitive to environmental variations and may go extinct in the next 250-500 years, depending on longevity of the seed bank. C. calceolus populations can persist in a protected area where there are only slow changes in habitat through secondary forest succession. The dramatic decrease in C. calceolus population size and area over 20 years in Eurasia suggests that many populations have experienced unforeseeable extrinsic disturbances or unfavourable habitat disturbances. Our Population Viability Analysis indicated the importance of habitat vs. individual conservation for the protection of C. calceolus populations. As this species is usually found within rich orchid communities, it should be used as an umbrella species in management plans.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of ecosystem responses to global change must embrace the reality of multiple, interacting environmental factors. Ecosystem models demonstrate the importance of examining the combined effects of the gradually rising concentration of atmospheric CO(2) and the climatic change that attends it. Models to forecast future changes need data support to be useful, and data-model fusion has become essential in global change research. There is a wealth of information on plant responses to CO(2) and temperature, but there have been few ecosystem-scale experiments investigating the combined or interactive effects of CO(2) enrichment and warming. Factorial experiments to investigate interactions can be difficult to design, conduct, and interpret, and their results may not support predictions at the ecosystem scale - in the context of global change they will always be case studies. An alternative approach is to gain a thorough understanding of the modes of action of single factors, and rely on our understanding (as represented in models) to inform us of the probable interactions. Multifactor (CO(2) x temperature) experiments remain important, however, for testing concepts, demonstrating the reality of multiple-factor influences, and reminding us that surprises can be expected.},

	Abstract = {The influence of dispersal limitation on species ranges remains controversial. Considering the dramatic impacts of the last glaciation in Europe, species might not have tracked climate changes through time and, as a consequence, their present-day ranges might be in disequilibrium with current climate. For 1016 European plant species, we assessed the relative importance of current climate and limited postglacial migration in determining species ranges using regression modelling and explanatory variables representing climate, and a novel species-specific hind-casting-based measure of accessibility to postglacial colonization. Climate was important for all species, while postglacial colonization also constrained the ranges of more than 50 per cent of the species. On average, climate explained five times more variation in species ranges than accessibility, but accessibility was the strongest determinant for one-sixth of the species. Accessibility was particularly important for species with limited long-distance dispersal ability, with southern glacial ranges, seed plants compared with ferns, and small-range species in southern Europe. In addition, accessibility explained one-third of the variation in species' disequilibrium with climate as measured by the realized/potential range size ratio computed with niche modelling. In conclusion, we show that although climate is the dominant broad-scale determinant of European plant species ranges, constrained dispersal plays an important supplementary role.},

Here, we examine effects of bear frugivory on the germination of three fruit-producing species. Specifically, we compare germination of gut-passed seeds to that of seeds mechanically-extracted from fruits and seeds that remained within fruits. For all species, germination in the mechanically-extracted and gut-passed treatments exceeded that of the whole fruit treatment. Our results suggest that for these three species, passage through the digestive tract of a bear positively influences germination by removing seeds from pulp, but that, gut-passage per se does not increase germination success.},

In Australia however, the primary function of an MPA is that of biodiversity conservation. Nonetheless, the management of Indigenous customary fisheries is one area where fisheries and biodiversity issues converge. This article examines the relationship between biodiversity and customary fisheries in an MPA context by investigation of the role and importance of Indigenous social contexts. Using case study examples from Australia, I explore the role of Indigenous social contexts in two dimensions: (i) management of traditional fisheries and (ii) Indigenous contribution to fisheries within an MPA. Findings demonstrate two narratives concerning social contexts, one of recognition and the other concerning Indigenous involvement in management. I conclude with a survey of Indigenous management initiatives within MPAs. The article ends with a discussion of the utility of understanding social contexts in any marine management endeavour, specifically other social contexts within an MPA.},

	Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change may threaten many species with extinction. However, species at risk today survived global climate change in recent geological history. Describing how habitat tracking and adaptation allowed species to survive warming since the end of the Pleistocene can indicate the relative importance of dispersal and natural selection during climate change. By taking this historical perspective, we can identify how contemporary climate change could interfere with these mechanisms and threaten the most vulnerable species. We focused on a group of closely related plant species in the genus Dodecatheon (Primulaceae) in eastern North America. Two rare species (Dodecatheon amethystinum and Dodecatheon frenchii) that are endemic to patchy cool cliffs may be glacial relicts whose ranges constricted following the last glacial maximum. Alternatively, these species may be extreme ecotypes of a single widespread species (Dodecatheon meadia) that quickly adapted to microclimatic differences among habitats. We test support for these alternative scenarios by combining ecophysiological and population genetic data at a regional scale. An important ecophysiological trait distinguishes rare species from D. meadia, but only a few northern populations of D. amethystinum are genetically distinctive. These relict populations indicate that habitat tracking did occur with historical climate change. However, relatively stronger evidence for isolation by distance and admixture suggests that local adaptation and genetic introgression have been at least as important. The complex response of Dodecatheon to historical climate change suggests that contemporary conservation efforts should accommodate evolutionary processes, in some cases by restoring genetic connectivity between ecologically differentiated populations.},

	Abstract = {Global change has a large and growing influence on forests, particularly in urban and urbanizing areas. Compared to rural forests, urban forests may experience warmer temperatures, higher CO2 levels, and greater nitrogen deposition, with exacerbated differences at urban forest edges. Thus, comparing urban to rural forests may help predict future effects of global change on forests. We focused on the conifer western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) to test three hypotheses: at urban forest edges, relative to rural forests and urban forest centers, trees experience 1) higher temperatures and nitrogen levels, 2) lower seedling recruitment, and 3) greater growth. We additionally tested anecdotal reports that 4) tree seedling recruitment in urban and rural forests is much lower than in "pristine" old-growth forests. To test these hypotheses, we quantified air temperature, soil nitrate, adult T. plicata growth and seedling recruitment in five urban and three rural parks at both forest edges and centers. We also quantified T. plicata recruitment at five old-growth "pristine" sites. Temperatures were highest at urban forest edges, and soil nitrate was highest in urban forests. In urban relative to rural forests, we observed greater T. plicata growth, but no difference in seedling densities. However, seedling densities were lower in urban and rural forests than in old-growth forests. In all, our results suggest urban influences enhance adult T. plicata growth, but not seedling recruitment. Recruitment in urban and rural forests was reduced compared to old-growth forests, implying that fragmentation and logging reduce T. plicata seedling recruitment.},

	Abstract = {A rationale is presented here for a primary role of bleaching in regulation of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis under conditions of stress. Corals and zooxanthellae have fundamentally different metabolic rates, requiring active homeostasis to limit zooxanthellae production and manage translocated products to maintain the symbiosis. The control processes for homeostasis are compromised by environmental stress, resulting in metabolic imbalance between the symbionts. For the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis the most direct way to minimize metabolic imbalance under stress is to reduce photosynthetic production by zooxanthellae. Two mechanisms have been demonstrated that do this: reduction of the chlorophyll concentration in individual zooxanthellae and reduction of the relative biomass of zooxanthellae. Both mechanisms result in visual whitening of the coral, termed bleaching. Arguments are presented here that bleaching provides the final control to minimize physiological damage from stress as an adversity response to metabolic imbalance. As such, bleaching meets the requirements of a stress response syndrome/general adaptive mechanism that is sensitive to internal states rather than external parameters. Variation in bleaching responses among holobionts reflects genotypic and phenotypic differentiation, allowing evolutionary change by natural selection. Thus, reef corals bleach to resist stress, and thereby have some capacity to adapt to and survive change. The extreme thermal anomalies causing mass coral bleaching worldwide lie outside the reaction norms for most coral-zooxanthellae holobionts, revealing the limitations of bleaching as a control mechanism.

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning methods, a family of statistical techniques with origins in the field of artificial intelligence, are recognized as holding great promise far the advancement of understanding and prediction about ecological phenomena. These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modi ling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical, modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar In this paper, we provide an introduction three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation.

	Abstract = {1. There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature. 2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates. 3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.},

	Abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presenceabsence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias species model: 1.31 and 0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and 0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26% habitat loss or UTF: 24% habitat loss vs. species model: 60% habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8% habitat gain or UTF: 12% habitat gain vs. species model: 51% habitat loss) in the climatic period 20702100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change.},

However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over-or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements.

Counting the maximum number of growth rings found at the tree base would significantly underestimate tree age. Counting terminal bud scars found on the entire trunk, including buried stem, would give a more accurate tree age. In this study, we compare recruitment dynamics obtained for aging seedlings in two balsam fir populations (about 500 km apart) using (i) the conventional method and (ii) bud scar counts.

	Abstract = {Mean global temperatures have risen this century, and further warming is predicted to continue for the next 50-100 years(1-3) Some migratory species can respond rapidly to yearly climate variation by altering the timing or destination of migration(4), but most wildlife is sedentary and so is incapable of such a rapid response. For these species, responses to the warming trend should be slower, reflected in poleward shifts of the range. Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population, stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals' movements, but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range. A northward range shift therefore occurs when there is net extinction at the southern boundary or net colonization at the northern boundary. However, previous evidence has been limited to a single species' or to only a portion of the species' range(6,7). Here we provide the first large-scale evidence of poleward shifts in entire species' ranges. In a sample of 35 non-migratory European butterflies, 63% have ranges that have shifted to the north by 35-240 km during this century, and only 3% have shifted to the south.},

	Abstract = {Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

	Abstract = {Current and predicted trends indicate that an increasing proportion of the world's population is living in urban and suburban places. The nature of the urban environment becomes an important factor if we are concerned with the restoration and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in and around cities. This article highlights the varied impacts of cities on soils and their implications for restoration planning and expectations of restoration "success." Urban soils exist in different historical and formational trajectories than their local nonurbanized counterparts due to direct anthropogenic disturbance and indirect environmental impacts from urbanization. Therefore, urban soils often exhibit altered physical, chemical, and biological characteristics in comparison to local nonurbanized soils. Several unique features of urban soils and urban ecosystems pose particular issues for ecological restoration or the improvement of degraded soil conditions in cities. The creation of novel soil types, conditions that promote invasion by non-natives, the strong influence of past land use on soil properties, and the presence of strong interactions and alternative stable states set up unique difficulties for the restoration of urban soils. Soils in urban restorations are a medium that can be deliberately manipulated to improve site conditions or in the monitoring of soil conditions as indices of ecosystem status. Including an explicit role for strong manipulations of soils in urban ecosystems changes how we approach baselines, management, and reference conditions in urban ecological restoration. With an understanding of urban soil ecological knowledge, we can guide aspects of urban ecological restoration toward successful outcomes.},

	Abstract = {In a guild of tide pool fishes on the outer coast of Washington State, USA, recruitment varied both temporally (seasonally and interannually) and spatially (over intervals of 4-5 km, across a maximum of 30 km of shoreline). Using census data and mark-recapture data, I studied the demography of four species of tide pool sculpins with the goal of understanding how variability in recruitment affected adult population patterns. I found that, although adult populations reflected well the most recent recruitment pulse for the two most common species, adult population growth rate was the most sensitive to changes in survivorship rates. Similarly, analyses of the effect that variance in each demographic parameter had on variability in subsequent adult population size also showed a disproportionate effect of adult survivorship on adult population sizes. In other words, high variability in a demographic estimate did not always result in high variability in population size. Negative density dependence was documented for all species, suggesting that recruitment effects are dampened by postrecruitment events. Thus, although recruitment events could be detected in the adult population for short time periods, postrecruitment events appeared to dampen the effects of seasonal recruitment pulses in these nearshore fishes.},

	Abstract = {Size-based matrix models have been an important analytical tool in the study of populations. Although size can be an important variable in determining demographic parameters such as survivorship, growth, and reproduction, other factors such as genetic variation and access to resources can play key roles. We determined that size was not the only state variable that explained the survivorship, reproduction and future growth of the annual kelp, Alaria nana. A. nana shows persistent differences among individuals in growth (growth autocorrelation) that could be characterized with a negative residual (relatively poor growth) or positive residual (relatively good growth) from the relationship between size and growth. In two separate years of demographic study, we show that, during good growth conditions, growth autocorrelation is relatively strong, while poorer growth conditions associated with the 1997 El Niho event resulted in less consistency among individuals in growth state. To quantitatively describe this population, we used a size based matrix model with an added state to reflect previous growth status. We show that a matrix projection model with growth state better captures the size structure of a natural population of A. nana and the fate of individuals than one that uses only size. Without growth state, a size-based model underestimates the number of individuals that get large and thus the potential grmkth rate of the population. When we used our model to approximate among generations pattern, and included a loop analysis algorithm, we found that fast growth to the largest size class contributed greatly to population growth in the relatively good year but that there were not such obvious benefits to getting large in the EI Niho year. The sizebased model with growth state that we present here is general and applicable to any species where persistent individual differences in performance violate the first-order Markov assumption of stage- or size-based matrix models.},

	Abstract = {In tall old forests, limitations to water transport may limit maximum tree height and reduce photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. We evaluated the degree to which tall trees could potentially compensate for hydraulic limitations to water transport by increased use of water stored in xylem. Using sap flux measurements in three tree species of the Pacific Northwest, we showed that reliance on stored water increases with tree size and estimated that use of stored water increases photosynthesis. For Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), water stored in xylem accounted for 20 to 25% of total daily water use in 60-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 7% of daily water use in 15-m trees. For Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Dougl. ex Hook.), water stored in xylem accounted for 10 to 23% of total daily water use in 25-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 9 to 13% of daily water use in 10-m trees. For ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.), water stored in xylem accounted for 4 to 20% of total daily water use in 36-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 2 to 4% of daily water use in 12-m trees. In 60-m Douglas-fir trees, we estimated that use of stored water supported 18% more photosynthesis on a daily basis than would occur if no stored water were used, whereas 15-m Douglas-fir trees gained 10% greater daily photosynthesis from use of stored water. We conclude that water storage plays a significant role in the water and carbon economy of tall trees and old forests.},

	Abstract = {Antbropogenic edge effects can compromise the conservation value of mature tropical forests. To date most edge-effect research in Amazonia has concentrated on forests in relatively seasonal locations or with poor soils in the east of the basin. We present the first evaluation from the relatively richer soils of far western Amazonia on the extent to which mature forest biomass, diversity, and composition are affected by edges. In a southwestern Amazonian landscape we surveyed woody plant diversity, species composition, and biomass in 88 x 0.1 ha samples of unflooded forest that spanned a wide range in soil properties and included samples as close as 50 m and as distant as > 10 km from anthropogenic edges. We applied Mantel tests, multiple regression on distance matrices, and other multivariate techniques to identify anthropogenic effects before and after accounting for soil factors and spatial autocorrelation. The distance to the nearest edge, accesspoint, and the geographical center of the nearest community ("anthropogenic-distance effects") all had no detectable effect on tree biomass or species diversity. Anthropogenic-distance effects on tree species composition were also below the limits of detection and were negligible in comparison with natural environmental and spatial factors. Analysis of the data set's capacity to detect anthropogenic effects confirmed that the forests were not severely affected by edges, although because our study had few plots within 100 m of forest edges, our confidence in patterns in the immediate vicinity of edges is limited. It therefore appears that the conservation value of most "edge" forests in this region has not yet been compromised substantially. We caution that because this is one case study it should not be overinterpreted, but one explanation for our findings may be that western Amazonian tree species are naturally faster growing and more disturbance adapted than those farther east.},

	Abstract = {Whether biotic interactions limit geographic ranges has long been controversial, and traditional analyses of static distribution patterns have made little progress towards resolving this debate. Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions and primarily ecological competition limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales. They also offer phylogenetic and trait-based metrics by which these interactions can be incorporated into ecological forecasting models.},

	Abstract = {Climate change research is increasingly focusing on the dynamics among species, ecosystems and climates. Better data about the historical behaviours of these dynamics are urgently needed. Such data are already available from ecology, archaeology, palaeontology and geology, but their integration into climate change research is hampered by differences in their temporal and geographical scales. One productive way to unite data across scales is the study of functional morphological traits, which can form a common denominator for studying interactions between species and climate across taxa, across ecosystems, across space and through time-an approach we call 'ecometrics'. The sampling methods that have become established in palaeontology to standardize over different scales can be synthesized with tools from community ecology and climate change biology to improve our understanding of the dynamics among species, ecosystems, climates and earth systems over time. Developing these approaches into an integrative climate change biology will help enrich our understanding of the changes our modern world is undergoing.},

	Abstract = {Museum specimens collected in the past may be a valuable source of information on the response of species to climate change. This idea was tested by comparing the flowering times during the year 2003 of 229 living plants growing at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, with 372 records of flowering times from 1885 to 2002 using herbarium specimens of the same individual plants. During this period, Boston experienced a 1.5degreesC increase in mean annual temperature. Flowering times became progressively earlier; plants flowered 8 d earlier from 1980 to 2002 than they did from 1900 to 1920. Most of this shift toward earlier flowering times is explained by the influence of temperature, especially temperatures in the months of February, March, April, and May, on flowering time. Plants with a long flowering duration appear to be as useful for detecting responses to changing temperatures as plants with a short flowering duration. Additional studies using herbarium specimens to detect responses to climate change could examine specimens from specific, intensively collected localities, such as mountain peaks, islands, and unique habitats.},

	Abstract = {Studies from throughout the world have provided evidence that climate change is already affecting the ecology and persistence of species. Japan contributes valuable insights into understanding these changes through long-term records of the timing of cherry blossoms and other phenomena of ecological and cultural interest. The wide latitudinal spread of Japan also provides an opportunity to examine species over a broad range of environmental conditions. In this review, we examine phenological studies that have taken place in Japan and summarize their significance to climate change and conservation research. In Kyoto, records of the timing of celebrations of cherry blossom festivals going back to the 9th century reconstruct the past climate and demonstrate the local increase in temperature associated with global warming and urbanization. This record is probably the longest annual record of phenology from anyplace in the world and shows that cherries are currently flowering earlier than they have at any time during the previous 1200 years. Detailed mapping of cherry tree flowering times in and around Osaka and other cities in Japan show that urbanization causes plants to flower earlier within the city environs than in nearby parks and outlying suburban areas. Flowering records from a large cherry arboretum at Mt. Takao, on the outskirts of Tokyo, show that both among and within species, early flowering is associated with greater responsiveness to temperature variation. Lastly, records of phenology for a wide range of plants and animals recorded at over 100 weather stations throughout Japan show that species vary greatly in their phenological responses to climate change, and highlight ecological relationships that need to be investigated in the field. Together, these studies provide important insights into how species are responding to climate change in Japan. Further research, particularly targeted field observations and experiments, is needed to build on these findings and to improve our understanding of how climate change is altering biological communities and how it will continue to affect them in the future.

	Abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of species phenological responses to global warming will require observations that are both long-term and spatially extensive. Here we present an analysis of the spring phenological response to climate variation of twelve taxa: six plants, three birds, a frog, and two insects. Phenology was monitored using standardized protocols at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005, and in some cases even longer. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and even in the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site-to-site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Our results challenge the assertion that trends in one geographic region can be extrapolated to others, and emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of the species response to global warming. Field studies are needed to determine how these patterns of variation in species response to climate change affect species interactions and the ability to persist in a changing climate.

They have also made significant contributions to the understanding of the relationships among climate, physiology, and anatomy. Gardens are finding new uses for traditional research tools such as herbarium specimens and historical photographs, which are increasingly being used to obtain information on past plant behavior. Additional work on invasive species and comparative studies of responses to climatic variation are providing insights on important ecological, evolutionary, and management questions.

	Abstract = {To determine the effectiveness of conservation efforts, scientists and land managers must evaluate the ability of conservation areas to protect biological diversity. The historic town of Concord, Massachusetts, home of the philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, provides a unique opportunity to examine how well conservation areas preserve biodiversity in a suburban landscape. About 35% of total land area in the town has been protected, and botanists, including Thoreau, have surveyed plants in Concord five times over the last 170 years. We spent 5 years (2003-2007) re-surveying a subset of Concord's flora for species presence and abundance. Of the species seen by Thoreau in the mid-19th century in Concord, we could not locate 27%, and an additional 36% persist in one or two populations where they are vulnerable to local extinction. Most species losses appear to have occurred in the past three to four decades. Certain groups, such as orchids, have shown particularly severe losses. More native species are declining in abundance than are increasing. Non-native species represent an increasing percentage of the flora, with many increasing in abundance. The flora has experienced a net loss of species over the past four decades, with 82 species gained and 236 species missing. Because many species are rare on a local scale, persisting as one or two small populations, local extinctions will likely continue in coming decades. Habitat management, primarily to prevent tree establishment, appears to have allowed many rare species of open habitats to persist and recover. Active management of existing sites will likely be the key to protecting the species diversity of the Concord flora and maintaining the living connection to the writings of Thoreau.

	Abstract = {Organisms may respond to changing environments by evading the new conditions or by adapting to them. Recently, a large body of evidence has been collected indicating that phenotypic adaptation to climate change is widespread. Adaptation may be achieved by phenotypic adjustment or by changes in the genetic composition of populations. Both processes can assure the survival of populations in changing environments, but at different time scales and at different costs. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms leading to adaptive phenotypic changes in birds may be complex, involving both plastic response and genetic change. Changes in the timing of breeding, for instance, seem to be predominantly caused by phenotypic adjustment to environmental conditions. Shifts in the genetic composition of populations have been demonstrated to be involved in recent changes in morphology and migratory behaviour. The presence of considerable amounts of additive genetic variation within and among avian populations, and examples of rapid evolutionary response to rare climatic events suggest that birds have a high potential for adaptive evolutionary change. However, it is presently unclear whether this is a general pattern, and which factors actually limit the adaptability of avian populations. Antagonistic genetic correlations and maladaptive phenotypic responses (evolutionary traps) are probably the most important constrains to microevolutionary change. Furthermore, the loss of genetic variation due to population declines, and gene flow in the presence of among-population variation in the response to climate change may limit the rate of adaptive evolution. Future research should try to identify the targets of selection and gauge the importance of constraints to microevolutionary change.},

	Abstract = {Aim To assess the geographical transferability of niche-based species distribution models fitted with two modelling techniques. Location Two distinct geographical study areas in Switzerland and Austria, in the subalpine and alpine belts. Methods Generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM and GAM) with a binomial probability distribution and a logit link were fitted for 54 plant species, based on topoclimatic predictor variables. These models were then evaluated quantitatively and used for spatially explicit predictions within (internal evaluation and prediction) and between (external evaluation and prediction) the two regions. Comparisons of evaluations and spatial predictions between regions and models were conducted in order to test if species and methods meet the criteria of full transferability. By full transferability, we mean that: (1) the internal evaluation of models fitted in region A and B must be similar; (2) a model fitted in region A must at least retain a comparable external evaluation when projected into region B, and vice-versa; and (3) internal and external spatial predictions have to match within both regions. Results The measures of model fit are, on average, 24% higher for GAMs than for GLMs in both regions. However, the differences between internal and external evaluations (AUC coefficient) are also higher for GAMs than for GLMs (a difference of 30% for models fitted in Switzerland and 54% for models fitted in Austria). Transferability, as measured with the AUC evaluation, fails for 68% of the species in Switzerland and 55% in Austria for GLMs (respectively for 67% and 53% of the species for GAMs). For both GAMs and GLMs, the agreement between internal and external predictions is rather weak on average (Kulczynski's coefficient in the range 0.3-0.4), but varies widely among individual species. The dominant pattern is an asymmetrical transferability between the two study regions (a mean decrease of 20% for the AUC coefficient when the models are transferred from Switzerland and 13% when they are transferred from Austria). Main conclusions The large inter-specific variability observed among the 54 study species underlines the need to consider more than a few species to test properly the transferability of species distribution models. The pronounced asymmetry in transferability between the two study regions may be due to peculiarities of these regions, such as differences in the ranges of environmental predictors or the varied impact of land-use history, or to species-specific reasons like differential phenotypic plasticity, existence of ecotypes or varied dependence on biotic interactions that are not properly incorporated into niche-based models. The lower variation between internal and external evaluation of GLMs compared to GAMs further suggests that overfitting may reduce transferability. Overall, a limited geographical transferability calls for caution when projecting niche-based models for assessing the fate of species in future environments.},

We argue that effective conservation of biodiversity is essential for human survival and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Despite some conservation successes (especially at local scales) and increasing public and government interest in living sustainably, biodiversity continues to decline. Moving beyond 2010, successful conservation approaches need to be reinforced and adequately financed. In addition, however, more radical changes are required that recognize biodiversity as a global public good, that integrate biodiversity conservation into policies and decision frameworks for resource production and consumption, and that focus on wider institutional and societal changes to enable more effective implementation of policy.},

	Abstract = {One of the predicted biological responses to climate warming is the upslope displacement of species distributions. In the tropics, because montane assemblages frequently include local endemics that are distributed close to summits, these species may be especially vulnerable to experiencing complete habitat loss from warming. However, there is currently a dearth of information available for tropical regions. Here, we present a preliminary appraisal of this extinction threat using the herpetological assemblage of the Tsaratanana Massif in northern Madagascar (the island's highest massif), which is rich with montane endemism. We present meteorological evidence (individual and combined regional weather station data and reanalysis forecast data) for recent warming in Madagascar, and show that this trend is consistent with recent climate model simulations. Using standard moist adiabatic lapse rates, these observed meteorological warming trends in northern Madagascar predict upslope species displacement of 17-74 m per decade between 1993 and 2003. Over this same period, we also report preliminary data supporting a trend for upslope distribution movements, based on two surveys we completed at Tsaratanana. For 30 species, representing five families of reptiles and amphibians, we found overall mean shifts in elevational midpoint of 19-51 m upslope (mean lower elevation limit 29-114 m; mean upper elevation limit -8 to 53 m). We also found upslope trends in mean and median elevational observations in seven and six of nine species analysed. Phenological differences between these surveys do not appear to be substantial, but these upslope shifts are consistent with the predictions based on meteorological warming. An elevational range displacement analysis projects complete habitat loss for three species below the 2 degrees C 'dangerous' warming threshold. One of these species is not contracting its distribution, but the other two were not resampled in 2003. A preliminary review of the other massifs in Madagascar indicates potential similar vulnerability to habitat loss and upslope extinction. Consequently, we urgently recommend additional elevational surveys for these and other tropical montane assemblages, which should also include, when possible, the monitoring of local meteorological conditions and habitat change.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to be most severe in northern regions and there has been much interest in to what extent organisms can cope with these changes through phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary processes. A red squirrel population in the southwest Yukon, Canada, faced with increasing spring temperatures and food supply has advanced the timing of breeding by 18 days over the last 10 years (6 days per generation). Longitudinal analysis of females breeding in multiple years suggests that much of this change in parturition date can be explained by a plastic response to increased food abundance (3.7 days per generation). Significant changes in breeding values (0.8 days per generation), were in concordance with predictions from the breeder's equation (0.6 days per generation), and indicated that an evolutionary response to strong selection favouring earlier breeders also contributed to the observed advancement of this heritable trait. The timing of breeding in this population of squirrels, therefore, has advanced as a result of both phenotypic changes within generations, and genetic changes among generations in response to a rapidly changing environment.},

	Abstract = {Global environmental change is altering the selection regime for all biota. The key selective factors are altered mean, variance and seasonality of climatic variables and increase in CO2 concentration itself. We review recent studies that document rapid evolution to global climate change at the phenotypic and genetic level, as a response to shifts in these factors. Among the traits that have changed are photoperiod responses, stress tolerance and traits associated with enhanced dispersal. The genetic basis of two traits with a critical role under climate change, stress tolerance and photoperiod behaviour, is beginning to be understood for model organisms, providing a starting point for candidate gene approaches in targeted nonmodel species. Most studies that have documented evolutionary change are correlative, while selection experiments that manipulate relevant variables are rare. The latter are particularly valuable for prediction because they provide insight into heritable change to simulated future conditions. An important gap is that experimental selection regimes have mostly been testing one variable at a time, while synergistic interactions are likely under global change. The expanding toolbox available to molecular ecologists holds great promise for identifying the genetic basis of many more traits relevant to fitness under global change. Such knowledge, in turn, will significantly advance predictions on global change effects because presence and polymorphism of critical genes can be directly assessed. Moreover, knowledge of the genetic architecture of trait correlations will provide the necessary framework for understanding limits to phenotypic evolution; in particular as lack of critical gene polymorphism or entire pathways, metabolic costs of tolerance and linkage or pleiotropy causing negative trait correlations. Synergism among stressor impacts on organismal function may be causally related to conflict among transcriptomic syndromes specific to stressor types. Because adaptation to changing environment is always contingent upon the spatial distribution of genetic variation, high-resolution estimates of gene flow and hybridization should be used to inform predictions of evolutionary rates.},

	Abstract = {Results from a national representative telephone survey of Americans in 2000 show that Internet and mobile phone usage was very similar, and that several digital divides exist with respect to both Internet and mobile phone usage. The study identifies and analyzes three kinds of digital divides for both the Internet and mobile phones-users/nonuser, veteran/recent, and continuing/dropout-and similarities and differences among those digital divides based on demographic variables. The gap between Internet users and nonusers is associated with income and age, but no longer with gender and race, once other variables are controlled. The gap between mobile phone users and nonusers is associated with income, work status, and marital status. The veteran/recent Internet gap is predicted by income, age, education, phone user, membership in community religious organizations, having children, and gender; for mobile phones, age, work status and marital status are predictors. The gap between continuing and dropout users is predicted by education for Internet usage and income for mobile phone usage. Finally, cross-categorization of Internet and mobile phone usage/nonusage is distinguished (significantly though weakly) primarily by income and education. Thus, there are several digital divides, each predicted by somewhat different variables; and while Internet and mobile phone usage levels in 2000 were about the same, their users overlap but do not constitute completely equivalent populations.

	Abstract = {The sensitivity of altitudinal and latitudinal tree-line ecotones to climate change, particularly that of temperature, has received much attention. To improve our understanding of the factors affecting tree-line position, we used the spatially explicit dynamic forest model TreeMig. Although well-suited because of its landscape dynamics functions, TreeMig features a parabolic temperature growth response curve, which has recently been questioned. and the species parameters are not specifically calibrated for cold temperatures. Our main goals were to improve the theoretical basis of the temperature growth response curve in the model and develop a method for deriving that curve's parameters from tree-ring data. We replaced the parabola with an asymptotic curve, calibrated for the main species at the subalpine (Swiss Alps: Pinus cembra, Larix decidua, Picea abies) and boreal (Fennoscandia: Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens, P. abies) tree-lines. After fitting new parameters, the growth curve matched observed tree-ring widths better. For the subalpine species, the minimum degree-day sum allowing, growth (kDDMin) was lowered by around 100 degree-days; in the case of Larix, the maximum potential ring-width was increased to 5.19 mm. At the boreal tree-line, the kDDMin for P. sylvestris was lowered by 210 degree-days and its maximum ring-width increased to 2.943 mm; for Betula (new in the model) kDDMin was set to 325 degree-days and the maximum ring-width to 2.51 mm; the values from the only boreal sample site for Picea were similar to the subalpine ones, so the same parameters were used. However, adjusting the growth response alone did not improve the model's output concerning species' distributions and their relative importance at tree-line. Minimum winter temperature (MinWiT, mean of the coldest winter month), which controls seedling establishment in TreeMig, proved more important for determining distribution. Picea, P. sylvestris and Betula did not previously have minimum winter temperature limits, so these values were set to the 95th percentile of each species' coldest MinWiT site (respectively -7, -11, -13). In a case study for the Alps, the original and newly calibrated versions of TreeMig were compared with biomass data from the National Forest Inventor), (NFI). Both models gave similar, reasonably realistic results. In conclusion, this method of deriving temperature responses from tree-rings works well. However, regeneration and its underlying factors seem more important for controlling species' distributions than previously thought. More research on regeneration ecology, especially at the upper limit of forests. is needed to improve predictions of tree-line responses to climate change further. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The method involved regressing quantitative trait similarity on marker-estimated relatedness between individuals sampled in the field. We sampled 300 adult plants from each of two transects, one along a stream habitat and another through a meadow habitat. For each plant we measured 10 quantitative characters and assayed 10 polymorphic isozyme loci. In the meadow habitat, relatedness of plants within 1 m was moderate (r = 0.125, corresponding to half-sibs) as was actual variance of relatedness (V-r = 0.044). Significant heritabilities of 50-70% were found for corolla width and the fitness characters of flower number and plant weight. Genetic correlations were strongly positive, but sharing of environmental effects within 1 m was weak. In the stream habitat, levels of relatedness were lower and similar heritabilities were indicated. To detect dominance variance and the correlation of phenotypes due to shared inbreeding, we also estimated higher-order coefficients of relationship and inbreeding, but these did not significantly differ from zero. Laboratory-based estimated of heritability in the field were lower than the marker-based estimated, indicating that natural heritabilities and genetic correlations may be stronger than indicated by controlled studies.},

Restricted-range species are clustered into centers of endemism, like those described for terrestrial taxa. The 10 richest centers of endemism cover 15.8% of the world's coral reefs (0.012% of the oceans) but include between 44.8 and 54.2% of the restricted-range species, Many occur in regions where reefs are being severely affected by people, potentially leading to numerous extinctions. Threatened centers of endemism are major biodiversity hotspots, and conservation efforts targeted toward them could help avert the loss of tropical reef biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {We examined the quantitative genetics of 20 floral traits in Mimulus guttatus including flowering time, autofertility, flower size, the spatial arrangement of flower parts, pollen and ovule production and seed number and size. A six by six diallel crossing design including selfs was performed in the glasshouse between plants derived from one population of M. guttatus from California. All characters with the exception of pollen number showed significant amounts of additive genetic variance indicating a potential to respond to selection. A principal components analysis revealed that some variation in many characters could be explained by general flower size. However, most characters still displayed heritable variation after the flower size effect was removed by analysis of covariance. Families showed considerable variation in the ability to self in glasshouse conditions. Only a weak relationship between autofertility and herkogamy was detected, suggesting that an unidentified mechanism was responsible for differences in selfing ability. Pollen quality and ovule production were also strongly heritable, suggesting the potential for gender specialization of plants but no trade-off between male and female function could be detected. Inbreeding depression was evident in flower size and pollen and ovule production. It is postulated that the heritable variation observed is maintained in this population through disruptive selection on autofertility in response to seasonal variation in the onset of spring drought and pollinator availability.},

	Abstract = {The ability of flower visitors to monitor returns when collecting pollen from flowers has been seldom studied despite the importance of pollen as a food resource, particularly for bees. Californian populations of Mimulus guttatus are polymorphic for pollen quality: many plants produce a high proportion of cytoplasmless pollen grains that render the grains incapable of fertilizing ovules or of supporting bees nutritionally. We found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen grains per flower was also consistent within a plant at each date but declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two patches of plants differed in quality. We found that bees could discriminate among plants on the basis of pollen quality provided that flowers still retained most of the pollen. In the two-genotype trials, bees chose genotypes primarily on the quantity of viable pollen, and nectar was much less important. Similarly, where patches of low- and high-pollen quality plants were established, bees responded by visiting the high-quality patch more often and by visiting more flowers within the patch. However, the results from the outdoor plots that contained genotypes of varying phenotypes were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of a large number of separate plots showed that the overall correlation between visitation rate and pollen quality was significant, but variation among plots was also significant. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was suggested in a greenhouse trial in which we showed that, when foraging density was high, depletion of the standing crop of pollen happened quickly, and this reduced the ability of the foragers to choose the higher-quality genotypes. The results have implications for the evolution of pollen production in Mimulus guttatus and reward production in other plants.},

	Abstract = {The effects of non-native invasive species are costly and environmentally damaging, and resources to slow their spread and reduce their effects are scarce. Models that accurately predict where new invasions will occur could guide the efficient allocation of resources to slow colonization. We assessed the accuracy of a model that predicts the probability of colonization of lakes in Wisconsin by Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). We based this predictive model on 9 years (1990-1999) of sequence data of milfoil colonization of lakes larger than 25 ha (n = 1803). We used milfoil colonization sequence data from 2000 to 2006 to test whether the model accurately predicted the number of lakes that actually were colonized from among the 200 lakes identified as being most likely to be colonized. We found that a lake's predicted probability of colonization was not correlated with whether a lake actually was colonized. Given the low predictability of colonization of specific lakes, we compared the efficacy of preventing milfoil from leaving occupied sites, which does not require predicting colonization probability, with protecting vacant sites from being colonized, which does require predicting colonization probability. Preventing organisms from leaving colonized sites reduced the likelihood of spread more than protecting vacant sites. Although we focused on the spread of a single species in a particular region, our results show the shortcomings of gravity models in predicting the spread of numerous non-native species to a variety of locations via a wide range of vectors.},

	Abstract = {The large investments needed if loss of biological diversity is to be stemmed will likely lead to increased public and political scrutiny of conservation strategies and the science underlying them. It is therefore crucial to understand the degree of consensus or divergence among scientists on core scientific perceptions and strategies most likely to achieve given objectives. I developed an internet survey designed to elucidate the opinions of conservation scientists. Conservation scientists (n =583) were unanimous (99.5%) in their view that a serious loss of biological diversity is likely, very likely, or virtually certain. Scientists agreement that serious loss is very likely or virtually certain ranged from 72.8% for Western Europe to 90.9% for Southeast Asia. Tropical coral ecosystems were perceived as the most seriously affected by loss of biological diversity; 88.0% of respondents familiar with that ecosystem type agreed that a serious loss is very likely or virtually certain. With regard to conservation strategies, scientists most often viewed understanding how people and nature interact in certain contexts and the role of biological diversity in maintaining ecosystem function as their priorities. Protection of biological diversity for its cultural and spiritual values and because of its usefulness to humans were low priorities, which suggests that many scientists do not fully support the utilitarian concept of ecosystem services. Many scientists expressed a willingness to consider conservation triage, engage in active conservation interventions, and consider reframing conservation goals and measures of success for conservation of biological diversity in an era of climate change. Although some heterogeneity of opinion is evident, results of the survey show a clear consensus within the scientific community on core issues of the extent and geographic scope of loss of biological diversity and on elements that may contribute to successful conservation strategies in the future.},

	Abstract = {Most studies that forecast the ecological consequences of climate change target a single species and a single life stage. Depending on climatic impacts on other life stages and on interacting species, however, the results from simple experiments may not translate into accurate predictions of future ecological change. Research needs to move beyond simple experimental studies and environmental envelope projections for single species towards identifying where ecosystem change is likely to occur and the drivers for this change. For this to happen, we advocate research directions that (i) identify the critical species within the target ecosystem, and the life stage(s) most susceptible to changing conditions and (ii) the key interactions between these species and components of their broader ecosystem. A combined approach using macroecology, experimentally derived data and modelling that incorporates energy budgets in life cycle models may identify critical abiotic conditions that disproportionately alter important ecological processes under forecasted climates.},

	Abstract = {In a variety of areas in ecology, a network approach has proven fruitful in studying the interactions among the components of systems. We propose a novel network approach for examining plant species interactions in plant communities. We constructed various networks based on the plant species found on 12 point-intercept transects in a semi arid community, developing one network for each transect. Species were identified as nodes and were considered linked if they occurred at the same intercept point. To understand the general organization of the networks, we calculated the cumulative distribution of the number of links per species in each network, the average nearest neighbour degree of each species, and the self-organization of the most-linked species. The networks behaved as mutualistic ecological systems and displayed a typical truncated power-law distribution for the cumulative distribution of the number of links per species. The results suggest that most of the species were preferentially associated with a few others. In all but one highly competitive species (Stipa tenacissima), the number of links and abundance were positively correlated. Link density was positively correlated with the spatial self-organization of the entomophyllous and facilitated species, while generalist species did not present any relation. For S. tenacissima, the link density and spatial self-organization were positively correlated, as other species were able to establish in the edge of S. tenacissima patches when it was less dominant. Our results agree with past works in networks, and it seems that in a semi-arid environment, at least, our network approach would provide additional information about the nature of interactions that each species develops in the community.

	Abstract = {Shallow-rooted grasses and deep-rooted shrubs dominate arid ecosystems where nitrogen is concentrated in the upper layers of the soil and water is distributed throughout. Analysis of mineral nitrogen and absorption patterns using a tracer indicated that shrubs in Patagonia absorbed nutrients from the lower, relatively nutrient-poor layers of the soil. Are they, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage with grasses that have the opposite pattern? Studies of nitrogen economy indicated that shrub and grass species have similar N-use efficiency but that they achieve it through opposite mechanisms. Shrubs have a conservative N economy absorbing annually only small fraction of their N content, whereas grasses have a more open N economy. This study about N-capture strategies in conjunction with previous studies about water-use by shrubs and grasses in the Patagonian Steppe suggest a coupling of N and water-capture strategies. Our findings have implications for the response of arid and semiarid ecosystems to global warming, nitrogen deposition, and biodiversity change. For example, climate change scenarios predict, for most arid regions, decreases in moisture availability that will result in a reduction in deep water, which in turn will reduce shrub density and result in a less conservative nitrogen economy.

	Abstract = {Scenarios of changes in biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, vegetation, and Land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably wilt have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

	Abstract = {Theory proposes that increased environmental stochasticity negatively impacts population viability. Thus, in addition to the directional changes predicted for weather parameters under global climate change (GCC), the increase in variance of these parameters may also have a negative effect on biodiversity. As a case study, we assessed the impact of interannual variance in precipitation on the viability of an Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) population reintroduced in Makhtesh Ramon Nature Reserve, Israel. We monitored the population from 1985 to 1999 to determine what environmental factors affect reproductive success. Annual precipitation during the year before conception, drought conditions during gestation, and population size determined reproductive success. We used the parameters derived from this model to assess population performance under various scenarios in a Leslie matrix type model with demographic and environmental stochasticity. Specifically, we used a change in the precipitation regime in our study area to formulate a GCC scenario and compared the simulated dynamics of the population with a no-change scenario. The coefficient of variation in population size under the global change scenario was 30% higher than under the no-change scenario. Minor die-offs (>= 15%) following droughts increased extinction probability nearly 10-fold. Our results support the idea that an increase in environmental stochasticity due to GCC may, in itself, pose a significant threat to biodiversity.},

Carbon storage in the 0 horizon and mineral soil, C concentration, and soil chemical properties in the mineral soil and spodic horizons were compared between forests and clearcuts, and between burned and un-burned clearcuts. Mean carbon storage was 131.3 Mg ha(-1) in clearcuts and 95.4 Mg ha(-1) in forests. Mean C concentration was 55.3 g kg(-1) in unburned clearcuts and 45.1 g kg(-1) in burned clearcuts. Several soil chemical properties were correlated with C concentrations, although causation of patterns was difficult to infer. Calcium (Ca) concentration was significantly higher in mineral soils of clearcuts than in uncut forests, with unburned clearcuts having the highest Ca concentration. This is a potentially important change in chemical cycling, because subalpine soils have low cation content. Clearcut logging may affect post-harvest soil C storage and other soil properties on a temporary basis, but with the exception of Ca, no long-term effects were apparent at these sites. Post-harvest burning appeared to have a minimal effect 20-40 yr following logging.},

	Abstract = {In two related field studies: (1) a multiscale riparian forest inventory and (2) a comparative study of natural forest gap and nongap environments, we explored regeneration patterns of native riparian trees in relation to large- and small-scale ecological drivers in four western Oregon watersheds spanning a climatic gradient from dry to wet. Twenty-three tree species were classified by life history traits into five functional groups that differed in shade and drought tolerance; distribution and abundance of tree regeneration were analyzed by group. For most groups, seedling abundance varied substantially across the large scale climate gradient. In particular, drought tolerant species decreased sharply in abundance from the drier to wetter watersheds. Overall seedling frequency and diversity also decreased from the driest to wettest watersheds, while nurse log use increased. Regeneration of most, but not all, species was greater in gaps. Principal conclusions are that life history information was useful for categorizing species and quite predictive of regeneration behavior overall, yet for many species contextual factors such as climate, forest structure, and adjoining species were also very important. Species appeared to regenerate opportunistically wherever local conditions fell within their environmental tolerances and competitive abilities. Management or restoration of riparian forests, therefore, requires knowledge of site conditions, the life history of the riparian trees present, and in particular an understanding of the species' environmental tolerances, disturbance responses, and competitive abilities relative to one another.

	Abstract = {Without robust and unbiased systems for monitoring, changes in natural systems will remain enigmatic for policy makers, leaving them without a clear idea of the consequences of any environmental policies they might adopt. Generally, biodiversity-monitoring activities are not integrated or evaluated across any large geographic region. The EuMon project conducted the first large-scale evaluation of monitoring practices in Europe through an on-line questionnaire and is reporting on the results of this survey. In September 2007 the EuMon project had documented 395 monitoring schemes for species, which represents a total annual cost of about (sic)4 million, involving more than 46,000 persons devoting over 148,000 person-days/year to biodiversity-monitoring activities. Here we focused on the analysis of variations of monitoring practices across a set of taxonomic groups ( birds, amphibians and reptiles, mammals, butterflies, plants, and other insects) and across 5 European countries ( France, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland). Our results suggest that the overall sampling effort of a scheme is linked with the proportion of volunteers involved in that scheme. Because precision is a function of the number of monitored sites and the number of sites is maximized by volunteer involvement, our results do not support the common belief that volunteer-based schemes are too noisy to be informative. Just the opposite, we believe volunteer-based schemes provide relatively reliable data, with state-of-the-art survey designs or data-analysis methods, and consequently can yield unbiased results. Quality of data collected by volunteers is more likely determined by survey design, analytical methodology, and communication skills within the schemes rather than by volunteer involvement per se.},

Natural history is the multidisciplinary description of nature, and naturalists are those who study nature. In its own right, natural history is a relevant discipline, despite varying degrees of focus by professional biologists and academic institutions over the past 100 years, and it is a critical contemporary discipline relative to global crises in the conservation of biodiversity. Many scholars have written that natural history has fallen out of favor at American universities. I review this perspective within the context of 20th century developments in society and trends in American higher education. My conclusion is that a narrowing of the context of natural history in the 20th century has diminished its significance. However, there is compelling evidence that, if we broaden our approach and horizons, natural history scholarship can play a pivotal role in American science and education in the 21st century. Institutions of higher education that emphasize natural history in their curriculum will enhance not only their academic profile but also students' appreciation of the importance of natural history throughout their lives.},

	Abstract = {With abundant evidence of recent climate warming, most vegetation studies have concentrated on its direct impacts, such as modifications to seasonal plant and animal life cycle events (phenology). The most common examples are indications of earlier onset of spring plant growth and delayed onset of autumn senescence. However, less attention has been paid to the implications of continued warming for plant species' chilling requirements. Many woody plants that grow in temperate areas require a certain amount of winter chilling to break dormancy and prepare to respond to springtime warming. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of plant species' responses to warming must also include the potential impacts of insufficient chilling. When collected at continental scale, plant species phenological data can be used to extract information relating to the combined impacts of warming and reduced chilling on plant species physiology. In this brief study, we demonstrate that common lilac first leaf and first bloom phenology (collected from multiple locations in the western United States and matched with air temperature records) can estimate the species' chilling requirement (1748 chilling hours, base 7.2 degrees C) and highlight the changing impact of warming on the plant's phenological response in light of that requirement. Specifically, when chilling is above the requirement, lilac first leaf/first bloom dates advance at a rate of -5.0/-4.2 days per 100-h reduction in chilling accumulation, while when chilling is below the requirement, they advance at a much reduced rate of -1.6/-2.2 days per 100-h reduction. With continental-scale phenology data being collected by the USA National Phenology Network (http://www.usanpn.org), these and more complex ecological questions related to warming and chilling can be addressed for other plant species in future studies.

	Abstract = {Conservation science strives to inform management decisions. Applying niche models in concert with future climate projections to project species vulnerability to extinction, range size loss, or distribution shifts has emerged as a potentially useful tool for informing resource management decisions. Making climate change niche modeling useful to conservation decisions requires centering studies on the types of decisions that are made regarding the focal taxa of a niche model study. Recent recommendations for climate adaptation strategies suggest four types of decision makers: policy, habitat protection, habitat management, species management. Targeting research to questions relevant for management decisions will increase utility of a niche model study. Constraints to the accuracy and precision of niche models to project potential future distributions are well-recognized. How to incorporate these uncertainties into management decision-making remains a challenge. Refining estimates and making sound management recommendations is critical because species that are generally modeled to be the most vulnerable to climate change (i.e., narrow endemics), are also the most vulnerable to bad decisions based on uncertain models. I review uncertainties of niche models to assert that there is an inherent bias for models to over-estimate climate-driven vulnerability to extirpation. Explicit recognition of this bias leads to a decision framework that accommodates unbalanced uncertainty. Namely, niche models may be more useful for identifying conservation opportunities identifying newly available habitats under changing climate than they are for asserting where current habitat will no longer exist under future climate states.

	Abstract = {Pollen grains of many wind-pollinated plants contain 1-3 air-filled bladders, or sacci. Sacci are thought to help orient the pollen grain in the pollination droplet. Sacci also increase surface area of the pollen grain, yet add minimal mass, thereby increasing dispersal distance; however, this aerodynamic hypothesis has not been tested in a published study. Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated. Several fossils were studied, including bisaccate (Pinus, Pteruchus, Caytonanthus), monosaccate (Gothania), and nonsaccate (Monoletes) pollen types.},

A recent call or natural resource professional societies to endorse position statements on economic growth raises questions about how scientific societies can and should a effectively contribute to policy development. Taking a stand on policy issues is akin to serving as a policy advocate. We believe that natural resource professionals can most constructively contribute to policy development by conducting rigorous research that is policy relevant and by effectively conveying the results and policy implications of that research to all parties interested in the issue. By actively engaging decisionmakers and providing information on pressing policy issues, professional societies can increase opportunities to be recognized as sources for reliable, unbiased information about natural resources and their management.},

	Abstract = {Copper tolerance is expressed in the diploid sporophyte as well as the microgametophyte of Mimulus guttatus. Previous studies, based on reproductive output, suggested that selection for copper tolerance could occur within the pistil. The objective of this study was to determine if selection within the pistil can increase sporophytic tolerance to copper and to determine whether this selection occurs pre- or postzygotically. Mixtures of pollen from copper tolerant or sensitive sources or from plants heterozygous for tolerance to copper were applied at two intensities to plants cloned and grown in control or copper supplemented solutions. The proportion of copper tolerant progeny showed a small, 7%, but significant increase when pollen recipients were grown with added copper. Comparisons of the numbers of tolerant progeny, as well as various components of reproduction, following light and heavy pollinations suggested that microgametophytic selection was unlikely to account for this increase. However, the 8 to 10% decrease in the seed/zygote ratio, compared to control values, was sufficient to account for the difference in proportion of copper tolerant progeny from control and copper treated plants. Thus, it appeared likely that selection for copper tolerance could occur within the pistil, and that much of this selection occurred postzygotically through the early failure of developing seeds.},

From an array of environmental and biological factors, only the thickness of fine A3 tephra deposit, elevation, and the relative dominance of A. amabilis in a stand showed significant effects on decline. Stand decline, a mean value of the decline conditions of individual trees in a stand, increased with increasing amounts of A3 tephra and decreased with increasing elevation and relative dominance of A. amabilis. Elevation and relative dominance of A. amabilis were positively correlated, complicating the interpretation of each variable alone; we suspect that each individually represents conditions that influenced the vigor A. amabilis predisposing it and (or) contributing to the initial tephra-induced stress and, therefore, affecting its survival and recovery.},

	Abstract = {Radial growth trends of old-growth mixed conifer forests were evaluated in areas impacted by tephra deposition from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington. These areas were characterized by a crown decline in Abies amabilis (Dougl.)Forbes (Pacific silver fir), associated with the long-term tephra retention by foliage. Post-1980 growth changes of A. amabilis were quantified using standard dendrochronological techniques in stands covering a range of crown decline conditions, amount of tephra deposited, elevation, and species composition. Time-series models revealed autocorrelations in the growth trend of all species at all sites. intervention analysis quantified posteruption radial growth changes and significantly improved the description of the original time series models. Growth reductions of A. amabilis were generally consistent with the mean crown decline conditions of individual sites. However, the magnitude of growth reductions did not correspond closely to the decline condition of the stand. Abies amabilis experienced significant post-1980 growth reductions in sites with high crown decline, but no growth changes were detected in sites with low decline. Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.)Sarg.(western hemlock) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France (Douglas-fir), which consistently occurred with A. amabilis in the study area, did either not experience growth reductions or had significant positive growth after 1981. This positive post-disturbance growth could be explained as a compensatory response to the appreciable growth decline of A. amabilis.},

	Abstract = {Stem analysis of mature Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes (Pacific silver fir) trees was used to analyze patterns of radial growth in areas of southwestern Washington where this species is experiencing a severe crown decline associated with heavy tephra deposition from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Reductions in stem growth after 1980 appeared to be related to the severity of crown damage. The largest reductions in cross-sectional area increment exceeded 50% and extended along most of the stem. An increase in stem growth in the upper crown was common among declining trees. This zone coincided with a portion of the crown that has experienced vigorous and rapid growth since 1980. The role of this recovery zone on subsequent tree recovery is discussed. Decline or recovery of trees appeared independent of crown class per se. Reductions in radial growth of declining trees tended to be more pronounced at breast height, suggesting that estimations of whole-stem growth based on breast height measurements would overestimate growth losses.},

	Abstract = {According to theory, gene flow to marginal populations may stall or aid adaptation at range limits by swamping peripheral populations with maladaptive gene flow or by enhancing genetic variability and reducing inbreeding depression, respectively. We tested these contrasting predictions by manipulating patterns of gene flow of the annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, at its warm range limit. Gene flow was experimentally applied by using crosses within warm-limit populations (selfed and outcrossed), between warm-limit populations, and between warm-limit and central range populations across two elevational transects. We measured the fitness of offspring in a common garden at the warm-edge species range limit. All sources of gene flow increased seedling emergence at the range limit, suggesting local inbreeding depression at both range limit populations; however, lifetime reproductive success only increased significantly when pollen originated from another warm-limit population. Center-to-warm-edge gene flow was maladaptive by delaying time to development at this warm, fast-drying range limit, whereas edge-to-edge gene flow hastened emergence time and time to reproduction. By empirically testing theory on the effects of gene flow on the formation of geographic range limits, we find benefits of gene flow among populations to be greatest when gene flow is between populations occupying the same range limit. Our results emphasize the overlooked importance of gene flow among populations occurring near the same range limit and highlight the potential for prescriptive gene flow as a conservation option for populations at risk from climate change.},

	Abstract = {Because the flowering and fruiting phenology of plants is sensitive to environmental cues such as temperature and moisture, climate change is likely to alter community-level patterns of reproductive phenology. Here we report a previously unreported phenomenon: experimental warming advanced flowering and fruiting phenology for species that began to flower before the peak of summer heat but delayed reproduction in species that started flowering after the peak temperature in a tallgrass prairie in North America. The warming-induced divergence of flowering and fruiting toward the two ends of the growing season resulted in a gap in the staggered progression of flowering and fruiting in the community during the middle of the season. A double precipitation treatment did not significantly affect flowering and fruiting phenology. Variation among species in the direction and magnitude of their response to warming caused compression and expansion of the reproductive periods of different species, changed the amount of overlap between the reproductive phases, and created possibilities for an altered selective environment to reshape communities in a future warmed world.},

Particularly in conservation and natural resource management contexts, where research often addresses complex social-ecological questions, the emphasis on and nature of this participation can significantly affect both the way that projects are designed and the outcomes that projects achieve. We review and integrate recent work in these and other fields, which has converged such that we propose the term public participation in scientific research (PPSR) to discuss initiatives from diverse fields and traditions. We describe three predominant models of PPSR and call upon case studies suggesting that-regardless of the research context-project outcomes are influenced by (1) the degree of public participation in the research process and (2) the quality of public participation as negotiated during project design. To illustrate relationships between the quality of participation and outcomes, we offer a framework that considers how scientific and public interests are negotiated for project design toward multiple, integrated goals. We suggest that this framework and models, used in tandem, can support deliberate design of PPSR efforts that will enhance their outcomes for scientific research, individual participants, and social-ecological systems.},

Here the suggest an alternative framework jot understanding this phenomenon: the competitive exclusion of native, non-synanthropic species by invasive species. We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities. This reduction in evenmess may be caused by a minority of invasive species dominating the majority of the resources, consequently excluding nonsynanthropic species that could otherwise adapt to urban conditions. We use foraging efficiency as a mechanism to explain the loss of diversity Thus, to understand the effects of habitat conversion oil biodiversity, and to sustain species-rich communities, future research should give more attention to interspecific interactions ill urban settings.},

	Abstract = {Global climates are changing rapidly and biological responses are becoming increasingly apparent. Here, we use empirical abundance patterns across an altitudinal gradient and predicted altitudinal range shifts to estimate change in total population size relative to distribution area in response to climate warming. Adopting this approach we predict that, for nine out of 12 species of regionally endemic birds, total population size will decline more rapidly than distribution area with increasing temperature. Two species showed comparable loss and one species exhibited a slower decline in population size with change in distribution area. Population size change relative to distribution area was greatest for those species that occurred at highest density in the middle of the gradient. The disproportional loss in population size reported here suggests that extinction risk associated with climate change can be more severe than that expected from decline in distribution area alone. Therefore, if we are to make accurate predictions of the impacts of climate change on the conservation status of individual species, it is crucial that we consider the spatial patterns of abundance within the distribution and not just the overall range of the species.},

	Abstract = {Despite the widespread recognition that urban areas are frequently dominated by exotic and invasive plants, the consequences of these changes in community structure have not been explicitly considered as an explanation for the pattern of advanced leaf phenology, or early greenup, reported in many urban areas. As such, we evaluated two hypotheses that could account for advanced greenup in forests along an urban to rural gradient: advanced phenology within individual species or differences in woody plant community. We monitored the spring leafing phenology of Aesculus glabra (Ohio buckeye), Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), and Acer negundo (box elder) in 11 forests spanning an urban to rural gradient in central Ohio, USA. From February to April 2006, we monitored these species, recorded woody plant composition, and documented daily minimum and maximum temperatures at each site. We found a weak but general trend of advanced phenology within species in more urban landscapes. Monthly average minimum temperatures were higher with increasing urbanization while monthly average maximum temperatures were similar across the urban to rural gradient. We also found evidence for shifts in woody plant communities along the urbanization gradient, mainly driven by the abundance of L. maackii, an invasive exotic species, in the more urban forests. Because L. maackii leafs out weeks earlier than native woody species and is very abundant in urban forests, we suggest that the invasion of forests by this species can generate earlier greenup of urban forests.},

	Abstract = {Traditional occupancy-abundance and abundance-variance-occupancy models do not take into account zero-inflation, which occurs when sampling rare species or in correlated counts arising from repeated measures. In this paper we propose a novel approach extending occupancy-abundance relationships to zero-inflated count data. This approach involves three steps: (1) selecting distributional assumptions and parsimonious models for the count data, (2) estimating abundance, occupancy and variance parameters as functions of site- and/or time-specific covariates, and (3) modelling the occupancy-abundance relationship using the parameters estimated in step 2. Five count datasets were used for comparing standard Poisson and negative binomial distribution (NBD) occupancy-abundance models. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) occupancy-abundance models were introduced for the first time, and these were compared with the Poisson, NBD, He and Gaston's and Wilson and Room's abundance-variance-occupancy models. The percentage of zero counts ranged from 45 to 80% in the datasets analysed. For most of the datasets, the ZINB occupancy-abundance model performed better than the traditional Poisson, NBD and Wilson and Room's model. He and Gaston's model performed better than the ZINB in two out of the five datasets. However, the occupancy predicted by all models increased faster than the observed as density increased resulting in significant mismatch at the highest densities. Limitations of the various models are discussed, and the need for careful choice of count distributions and predictors in estimating abundance and occupancy parameter are indicated.

	Abstract = {Ways of reducing the drivers of global biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystem services are needed more than ever before. Policy options must be based on the best evidence of the role of multiple driving forces. Increasingly, a significant part of the evidence base comes from attributing signals of biological change detected in large-scale analytical surveys to a range of possible causal factors. We highlight a number of subtle difficulties that can beset the challenge of detecting such correlative relationships. These are as follows: (1) The Modifiable Area Unit Problem. (2) Incomplete explanatory variable data. (3) Lack of control over the replication and crossing of driving variables. In most cases these problems can be avoided by more careful specification of the scientific question and application of relatively new analytical techniques. Ignoring them can lead to mis-specification of hypothesised driver-state-impact relationships and flawed conclusions as to the most important causes of change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Quantitative conservation methodologies such as Population Viability Analysis (PVA) require reliable estimates of life history parameters such as breeding success. The utility of such metrics for egg-laying species is complicated by the fact that the mortality of eggs and juveniles can occur both randomly and independently over time,. or catastrophically, as in the sudden loss of a clutch or brood. Not knowing the nature of mortality caused by either or both of abiotic (e.g., weather) and biotic (e.g., predation) events limits our. ability to confidently assess a population's demography and. sustainability, or rank competing hypotheses. To address this deficiency, we describe a statistical model that estimates egg and juvenile survival rates continuously from laying to fledging based on periodic observations of individual clutches and broods. Adjunct data on environmental or predation threats can be included in the model as covariate series potentially affecting juvenile survival. Our model can statistically characterize mortality between the extremes of random and catastrophic mortality and can determine if unwitnessed mortalities occurred independently or were correlated (i.e., overdispersed, where catastrophe is extreme overdispersion). Overdispersion is estimated as a parameter of the beta-binomial probability distribution of survival. outcomes, which differs from its treatment in Program MARK where overdispersion is an a posteriori diagnostic referred to as e. We used data for the sea duck Barrow's Goldeneye to illustrate our model. Specifically, we contribute to the argument that a larger brood confers a fitness advantage to a tending hen by concluding that brood size on hatch day is positively correlated with a juvenile's probability of surviving to fledge.},

Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were examined in Gaultheria and Rhododendron to assess their assumed presence in soils of the Pacific Northwestern region of the United States. Nine ectomycorrhizal types were recognized on the conifers and two on the Ericaceae. All nine ectomycorrhizal types occurred on both conifer species, and the two ectomycorrhizal types on the ericaceous hosts resembled types associated with the conifer hosts.

	Abstract = {Recent hypotheses of timberline causation include the possibility that limitations to growth processes may be more limiting than restrictions on photosynthetic carbon gain, and that cold soil is a primary limiting factor at high altitude. However, almost all of the supporting data for timberline causation have come from studies on older trees, with little focus on the mechanisms of seedling establishment and the growth of saplings away from the forest edge into the treeline ecotone. We describe a conceptual model of timberline migration that invokes a strong dependence on ecological facilitation, beginning with seed germination and continuing through seedling establishment and sapling growth to the stage where trees with forest-like stature form new subalpine forest at a higher altitude. In addition to protection from severe mechanical damage, facilitation of photosynthetic carbon gain and carbon processing is enhanced by plasticity in plant form and microsite preference, enabling seedling survival and sapling growth inside and through the often severe boundary layer just above the ground cover. Several forms of facilitation (inanimate, interspecific, intraspecific and structural) result in substantial increases in photosynthetic carbon gain throughout the summer growth period, leading to enhanced root growth, subsequent amelioration of drought stress, and increased seedling survival. Avoidance of low temperatures and low-temperature photoinhibition of photosynthesis may be major benefits of the facilitation, enhancing photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory-driven growth processes. We propose that the growth of vertical stems (flagged tree forms) from krummholz mats is analogous functionally to the facilitated growth of a seedling/sapling in and away from ground cover. Increasing abundance and growth of newly established trees in the treeline ecotone generates a structural and microsite facilitation characteristic of the subalpine forest below. This is followed by the formation of new subalpine forest with forest-like trees, and a new timberline at higher altitude.},

	Abstract = {The polychaetes assemblage structure was used in order to investigate taxonomic sufficiency in a heavily polluted tropical bay. Species abundance was aggregated into progressively higher taxa matrices (genus, family, order) and was analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Polychaetes distribution in Guanabara Bay (GB) was in accordance with a pollution gradient, probably ruled by the organic enrichment, consequent effects of hypoxia and altered redox conditions coupled with prevailing patterns of circulation. Within the sectors of GB, an increasing gradient in species richness and occurrence was observed, ranging from the azoic and impoverished stations in the inner sector to a well-structured community in terms of species composition and abundance inhabiting the outer sector. Multivariate statistical analysis showed similar results when species were aggregated into genera and families, while greater difference occurred at coarser taxonomic identification (order). The literature about taxonomic sufficiency has demonstrated that faunal patterns at different taxonomic levels tend to become similar with increased pollution. In GB, an analysis carried out solely at family level is perfectly adequate to describe the environmental gradient, considered a useful tool for a quick environmental assessment.

Here, we examine phenological change and synchrony from one such garden in western Poland. We analysed 66 botanical phenophases and 18 interphase intervals recorded between 1977 and 2007 from the PoznaA" Botanical Garden. These were examined for trends through time and responsiveness to temperature. Furthermore, we derived measures of synchrony for start of spring and end of autumn events to assess if these had changed over time. All 39 events with a mean date before mid-July demonstrated a significant negative relationship with temperature. Where autumn events were significantly related to temperature, they indicated a positive relationship. Typically, spring events showed an advance over time and autumn events a delay. Interphase intervals tended to lengthen over the study period. The measures of synchrony changed significantly over time suggesting less synchrony among spring events and also among autumn events. In combination, these results suggest increases in growing season length. However, responses to a changing climate were species-specific. Thus, the transitions from winter into spring and from autumn into winter are becoming less clearly defined.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variation in fall cold damage in coastal Doualas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) was measured by exposing excised branches of seedlings from 666 source locations grown in a common garden to freezing temperatures in a programmable freezer. Considerable variation was found among populations in fall cold hardiness of stems, needles, and buds compared with bud burst, bud set, and biomass growth after 2 years. Variation in fall cold hardiness was strongly correlated (r = 0.67) with cold-season temperatures of the source environment. Large population differences corresponding with environmental gradients are evidence that natural selection has been important in determining genetic variation in fall cold hardiness, much more so than in traits of bud burst (a surrogate for spring cold hardiness), bud set, and growth. Seed movement guidelines and breeding zones may be more restrictive when considering genetic variation in fall cold hardiness compared with growth, phenology, or spring cold hardiness. A regional stratification system based on ecoregions with latitudinal and elevational divisions, and roughly corresponding with breeding zones used in Oregon and Washington, appeared to be adequate for minimizing population differences within regions for growth and phenology, but perhaps not fall cold hardiness. Although cold hardiness varied among populations, within-population and within-region variation is sufficiently large that responses to natural or artificial selection may be readily achieved.},

	Abstract = {Background: Monitoring change in species diversity, community composition and phenology is vital to assess the impacts of anthropogenic activity and natural change. However, monitoring by trained scientists is time consuming and expensive. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using social networks, we assess whether it is possible to obtain accurate data on bee distribution across the UK from photographic records submitted by untrained members of the public, and if these data are in sufficient quantity for ecological studies. We used Flickr and Facebook as social networks and Flickr for the storage of photographs and associated data on date, time and location linked to them. Within six weeks, the number of pictures uploaded to the Flickr BeeID group exceeded 200. Geographic coverage was excellent; the distribution of photographs covered most of the British Isles, from the south coast of England to the Highlands of Scotland. However, only 59% of photographs were properly uploaded according to instructions, with vital information such as 'tags' or location information missing from the remainder. Nevertheless, this incorporation of information on location of photographs was much higher than general usage on Flickr (similar to 13%), indicating the need for dedicated projects to collect spatial ecological data. Furthermore, we found identification of bees is not possible from all photographs, especially those excluding lower abdomen detail. This suggests that giving details regarding specific anatomical features to include on photographs would be useful to maximise success. Conclusions/Significance: The study demonstrates the power of social network sites to generate public interest in a project and details the advantages of using a group within an existing popular social network site over a traditional (specifically-designed) web-based or paper-based submission process. Some advantages include the ability to network with other individuals or groups with similar interests, and thus increasing the size of the dataset and participation in the project.},

	Abstract = {Time series of population abundance estimates often are the only data available for evaluating the prospects for persistence of a species of concern. With such data, it is possible to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) with diffusion approximation methods using estimates of the mean population trend and the variance of the trend, the so-called process variation. Sampling error in the data, however, may bias estimators of process variation derived by simple methods. We develop a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based method for estimating trend, process variation, and sampling error from a single time series based on a discrete-time model of density-independent growth coupled with a model of the sampling process. Transformation of the data yields a conventional linear mixed model, in which the variance components are functions of the process variation and sampling error. Simulation results show essentially unbiased estimators of trend, process variation, and sampling error over a range of process variation/sampling error combinations. Example data analyses are provided for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus), and Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata). This REML-based method is useful for PVA methods that depend on accurate estimation of process variation from time-series data.},

	Abstract = {Marine invertebrates representing at least five phyla are symbiotic with dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium. This group of single-celled protists was once considered to be a single pandemic species, Symbiodinium microadriaticum. Molecular investigations over the past 25 years have revealed, however, that Symbiodinium is a diverse group of organisms with at least eight (A-H) divergent clades that in turn contain multiple molecular subclade types. The diversity within this genus may subsequently determine the response of corals to normal and stressful conditions, leading to the proposal that the symbiosis may impart unusually rapid adaptation to environmental change by the metazoan host. These questions have added importance due to the critical challenges that corals and the reefs they build face as a consequence of current rapid climate change. This review outlines our current understanding of the diverse genus Symbiodinium and explores the ability of this genus and its symbioses to adapt to rapid environmental change.

	Abstract = {Range limits of temperate high-attitude plants may be controlled by tradeoffs between physically severe but uncrowded conditions, versus mild but crowded conditions. Because up-slope migration of lowland species may accompany global warming and earlier snowmelt, I tested whether crowding by neighbors vs. timing of snowmelt limit Potentilla diversifolia to later-melting sites in the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.). I transplanted individuals from two altitudes to experimental plots within and below the species' range limit, and experimentally altered snowmelt timing and the density of neighboring vegetation. In contrast to theoretical predictions for biotic control of lower range limits, higher temperatures and drier soils contributed to markedly reduced survivorship and reproduction below the native-range regardless of treatment. Neighbor removal only marginally increased performance both within and below the native-range, suggesting that interactions with neighboring vegetation are much less important for distribution than abiotic factors. Populations from the subalpine zone had longer growth intervals and grew larger than those from the alpine tundra in their native sites, but did not outperform alpine tundra populations when grown below the species' range. Although earlier snowmelt enhances growth, phenotypic plasticity may enable P. diversifolia to persist in later-melting tundra sites while higher temperatures and drought restrict it from much of the subalpine zone.},

(4) What abiotic and biotic local site conditions are most important in structuring establishment patterns? (5) Does the abiotic setting become more important with increasing upslope distance from the forest line? Western slopes of Mount Rainier, USA. We performed classification analysis of 1970 satellite imagery and 2003 aerial photography to delineate establishment. Local site conditions were calculated from a LIDAR-based DEM, ancillary climate data, and 1970 tree locations in a GIS. We used logistic regression on a spatially weighted landscape matrix to rank variables. Considerable establishment after 1970 caused forest line elevation to increase over 150 m in specific locations. Landscape heterogeneity increased with distance from the 1970 forest line. At a broad spatial context, we found establishment was most common near existing trees (0-50 m) and at low elevations (1250-1350 m). Slope aspect (W, NW, N, NE, and E), slope angle (40-60 degrees), and other abiotic factors emerged as important predictors of establishment with increasing upslope distance from the forest line to restricted spatial extents. Favorable climatic conditions likely triggered widespread tree establishment. Readily available seed probably enhanced establishment rates near sexually mature trees, particularly in the less stressful environment at low elevations. The mass effect of nearly ubiquitous establishment in these areas may have obscured the importance of the abiotic setting to restricted spatial extents. Topographic variability apparently produced favorable sites that facilitated opportunistic establishment with increasing upslope distance from the forest line, thereby enabling additional trees to invade the alpine tundra.},

	Abstract = {Climate change may shrink and/or shift plant species ranges thereby increasing their vulnerability and requiring targeted conservation to facilitate adaptation. We quantified the vulnerability to climate change of plant species based on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and assessed the effects of including these components in complementarity-based spatial conservation prioritisation. We modelled the vulnerability of 584 native plant species under three climate change scenarios in an 11.9 million hectare fragmented agricultural region in southern Australia. We represented exposure as species' geographical range under each climate change scenario as quantified using species distribution models. We calculated sensitivity as a function of the impact of climate change on species' geographical ranges. Using a dispersal kernel, we quantified adaptive capacity as species' ability to migrate to new geographical ranges under each climate change scenario. Using Zonation, we assessed the impact of individual components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) on spatial conservation priorities and levels of species representation in priority areas under each climate change scenario. The full vulnerability framework proved an effective basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities under climate change. Including different dimensions of vulnerability had significant implications for spatial conservation priorities. Incorporating adaptive capacity increased the level of representation of most species. However, prioritising sensitive species reduced the representation of other species. We conclude that whilst taking an integrated approach to mitigating species vulnerability to climate change can ensure sensitive species are well-represented in a conservation network, this can come at the cost of reduced representation of other species. Conservation planning decisions aimed at reducing species vulnerability to climate change need to be made in full cognisance of the sensitivity of spatial conservation priorities to individual components of vulnerability, and the trade-offs associated with focussing on sensitive species.},

	Abstract = {1. Fundamental ecological research is both intrinsically interesting and provides the basic knowledge required to answer applied questions of importance to the management of the natural world. The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. 2. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. 3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. 4. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. 5. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. 6. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

We show that, in a California grassland, species interactions strongly influence responses to changing climate, overturning direct climatic effects within 5 years. We manipulated the seasonality and intensity of rainfall over large, replicate plots in accordance with projections of leading climate models and examined responses across several trophic levels. Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years. Changes in these natural grassland communities suggest a prominent role for species interactions in ecosystem response to climate change.},

	Abstract = {With the marine environment under increasing threat from multiple sources, the ability of managers to generate support from stakeholders will be vital for the success of conservation initiatives. In 2004, a new zoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park increased no-take areas from 4.5% to 33% of the total Park area. The aims of this study were to measure recreational fishers' level of support for the plan and understand how they form attitudes towards conservation initiatives in the Park. A Survey of Great Barrier Reef Marine Park recreational fishers conducted three years after implementation of the new, zoning plan revealed that 68% of fishers believed that, in general, rezoning the Marine Park was a good idea, whereas 57% Supported the actual zoning plan that was implemented. A majority of fishers believed that rezoning the Marine Park was necessary, that the new zoning plan had high conservation value, and that the plan had little impact on their recreational fishing activity. However, most fishers had low to moderate satisfaction with the programme used to Consult the public throughout the rezoning process. Logistic regression models revealed a strong relationship between level of support for the plan and fishers' perceptions about the necessity of the plan and its conservation value, the adequacy of the consultation process, and the impact of the plan on their fishing activity. Results indicate that recreational fishers call be strong Supporters of conservation initiatives in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park if these initiatives are consistent with their values, and if efforts are made to engage them in the decision making process. These results will enhance the ability of managers to generate support from the recreational fishing community for conservation initiatives in marine environments.},

	Abstract = {Competition is believed to be a central force limiting local diversity and controlling the structure of plant communities. However, it has been proposed that the stressed understory environment limits total understory plant density to such low levels that competitive exclusion cannot be an important factor limiting the local diversity of understory plants. To evaluate the importance of inter-seedling competition, we performed a seedling competition experiment with five shade-tolerant species in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Three-month-old seedlings were transplanted into the forest singly or with their roots intertwined with a single conspecific or heterospecific seedling in all pairwise species combinations. If competition is important, performance (survival, stem height, and number of leaves after one and six years) would be expected to be lowest with a conspecific neighbor and greatest without a neighbor. The experiment was replicated in five 0.24-m(-2) plots at each of 20 sites in tall secondary forest. To test whether seedling performance differed among treatments we fitted linear mixed models (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), treating species identity and microsite (site and plot) as random effects. The five shade-tolerant study species all experienced good establishment with relatively high survival and growth rates. The neighbor treatment consistently affected seedling performance, but the effect was always very small, both in absolute terms and relative to the much stronger species and microsite effects. Seedlings with a conspecific neighbor consistently performed worse than seedlings with a heterospecific neighbor, but having no neighbor generally did not cause superior performance relative to the other treatments. We conclude that direct competitive interactions are relatively unimportant among understory plants in humid tropical forests.},

	Abstract = {The relative importance of contemporary climate and history as controls of geographical diversity patterns is intensely debated. A key example is the controversy over the extent to which temperate tree distributions and diversity patterns reflect postglacial dispersal limitation. Here, we focus on Central and Northern Europe, and show that recent estimates of tree migration rates < 100 m year(-1) imply that many species have probably not reached equilibrium with climate in this region. We then demonstrate that geographical accessibility from glacial refuges explains 78% of the geographical variation in the region's tree diversity and is a much stronger diversity predictor than climate. Finally, we show that realistic estimates of migration rates can be derived from the observed tree diversity pattern by assuming it to be purely dispersal driven. In conclusion, the tree diversity pattern in Central and Northern Europe could, to a large extent, be a result of postglacial dispersal limitation.},

	Abstract = {Aim While niche models are typically used to assess the vulnerability of species to climate change, they have been criticized for their limited assessment of threats other than climate change. We attempt to evaluate this limitation by combining niche models with life-history models to investigate the relative influence of climate change and a range of fire regimes on the viability of a long-lived plant population. Specifically, we investigate whether range shift due to climate change is a greater threat to an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub than altered fire frequency and how these two threatening processes might interact. Location Australian sclerophyll woodland and heathland. Methods The study species is Leucopogon setiger, an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub. A spatially explicit stochastic matrix model was constructed for this species and linked with a dynamic niche model and fire risk functions representing a suite of average fire return intervals. We compared scenarios with a variety of hypothetical patches, a patch framework based upon current habitat suitability and one with dynamic habitat suitability based on climate change scenarios A1FI and A2. Results Leucopogon setiger was found to be sensitive to fire frequency, with shorter intervals reducing expected minimum abundances (EMAs). Spatial decoupling of fires across the landscape reduced the vulnerability of the species to shortened fire frequencies. Shifting habitat, while reducing EMAs, was less of a threat to the species than frequent fire. Main conclusions Altered fire regime, in particular more frequent fires relative to the historical regime, was predicted to be a strong threat to this species, which may reflect a vulnerability of obligate seeders in general. Range shifts induced by climate change were a secondary threat when habitat reductions were predicted. Incorporating life-history traits into habitat suitability models by linking species distribution models with population models allowed for the population-level evaluation of multiple stressors that affect population dynamics and habitat, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impacts of global change than would be gained by niche models alone. Further investigations of this type could elucidate how particular bioecological factors can affect certain types of species under global change.},

	Abstract = {While coral reefs in many parts of the world are in decline as a direct consequence of human pressures, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is unusual in that direct human pressures are low and the entire system of similar to 2,900 reefs has been managed as a marine park since the 1980s. In spite of these advantages, standard annual surveys of a large number of reefs showed that from 1986 to 2004, average live coral cover across the GBR declined from 28 to 22%. This overall decline was mainly due to large losses in six (21%) of 29 subregions. Declines in live coral cover on reefs in two inshore subregions coincided with thermal bleaching in 1998, while declines in four mid-self subregions were due to outbreaks of predatory starfish. Otherwise, living coral cover increased in one subregion (3%) and 22 subregions (76%) showed no substantial change. Reefs in the great majority of subregions showed cycles of decline and recovery over the survey period, but with little synchrony among subregions. Two previous studies examined long-term changes in live coral cover on GBR reefs using meta-analyses including historical data from before the mid-1980s. Both found greater rates of loss of coral and recorded a marked decrease in living coral cover on the GBR in 1986, coinciding exactly with the start of large-scale monitoring. We argue that much of the apparent long-term decrease results from combining data from selective, sparse, small-scale studies before 1986 with data from both small-scale studies and large-scale monitoring surveys after that date. The GBR has clearly been changed by human activities and live coral cover has declined overall, but losses of coral in the past 40-50 years have probably been overestimated.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the process by which hybrid incompatibility alleles become established in natural populations remains a major challenge to evolutionary biology. Previously, we discovered a two-locus Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility that causes severe hybrid male sterility between two inbred lines of the incompletely isolated wildflower species, Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. An interspecific cross between these two inbred lines revealed that the M. guttatus (IM62) allele at hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) acts dominantly in combination with recessive M. nasutus (SF5) alleles at hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) to cause nearly complete hybrid male sterility. In this report, we extend these genetic analyses to investigate intraspecific variation for the hms1-hms2 incompatibility in natural populations of M. nasutus and M. guttatus, performing a series of interspecific crosses between individuals collected from a variety of geographic locales. Our results suggest that hms2;2 incompatibility alleles are common and geographically widespread within M. nasutus, but absent or rare in M. guttatus. In contrast, the hms1 locus is polymorphic within M. guttatus and the incompatibility allele appears to be extremely geographically restricted. We found evidence for the presence of the hms1 incompatibility allele in only two M. guttatus populations that exist within a few kilometers of each other. The restricted distribution of the hms1 incompatibility allele might currently limit the potential for the hms1-hms2 incompatibility to act as a species barrier between sympatric populations of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Extensive sampling within a single M. guttatus population revealed that the hms1 locus is polymorphic and that the incompatibility allele appears to segregate at intermediate frequency, a pattern that is consistent with either genetic drift or natural selection.},

	Abstract = {A bioclimatic model based on physiological constraints to plant growth and regeneration is used here in an empirical way to describe the present natural distributions of northern Europe's major trees. Bioclimatic variables were computed from monthly means of temperature, precipitation and sunshine (%) interpolated to a 10' grid taking into account elevation. Minimum values of mean coldest-month temperature (T-c) and 'effective' growing degree days (GDD*) were fitted to species' range limits. GDD* is total annual growing degree days (GDD) minus GDD to budburst (GDD(o)). Each species was assigned to one of the chilling-response categories identified by Murray, Cannell & Smith (1989) to calculate GDD(o). Maximum T-c values were fitted to continental species' mild-winter limits and other deciduous species' warm-winter limits. Minimum values of relative growing-season moisture availability (alpha*) were estimated from silvics. Growth indices were calculated based on potential net assimilation (a quadratic in daily temperature) and alpha*. Growth can be rapid near a range limit, e.g. Picea abies (L.) Karsten in southern Sweden. Climate changes expected for CO2 doubling were projected on to the grid. Simulated distribution changes reflected interspecific differences in response to changing seasonality. Chilling responses proved important, e.g. the predicted range limit of Fagus sylvatica L. contracts in the west while expanding northwards as winters warm more than summers. Transient responses to climate change can be modelled using the same information provided that fundamental and realized niche limitations are distinguished-a caveat that underlines the dearth of experimental information on the climatic requirements for growth, and especially regeneration, of many important trees.},

	Abstract = {The process of population extinction due to inbreeding depression with constant demographic disturbances every generation is analysed using a population genetic and demographic model. The demographic disturbances introduced into the model represent loss of population size that is induced by any kind of human activities, e.g. through hunting and destruction of habitats. The genetic heterozygosity among recessive deleterious genes and the population size are assumed to be in equilibrium before the demographic disturbances start. The effects of deleterious mutations are represented by decreases in the growth rate and carrying capacity of a population. Numerical simulations indicate rapid extinction due to synergistic interaction between inbreeding depression and declining population size for realistic ranges of per-locus mutation rate, equilibrium population size, intrinsic rate of population growth, and strength of demographic disturbances. Large populations at equilibrium are more liable to extinction when disturbed due to inbreeding depression than small populations. This is a consequence of the fact that large populations maintain more recessive deleterious mutations than small populations. The rapid extinction predicted in the present study indicates the importance of the demographic history of a population in relation to extinction due to inbreeding depression.},

	Abstract = {A mother can influence a trait in her offspring both by the genes she transmits (Mendelian inheritance) and by maternal attributes that directly affect that trait in her offspring (maternal inheritance). Maternal inheritance can alter the direction, rate, and duration of adaptive evolution from standard Mendelian models and its impact on adaptive evolution is virtually unexplored in natural populations. In a hierarchical quantitative genetic analysis to determine the magnitude and structure of maternal inheritance in the winter annual plant, Collinsia verna, I consider three potential models of inheritance. These range from a standard Mendelian model estimating only direct (i.e., Mendelian) additive and environmental variance components to a maternal inheritance model estimating six additive and environmental variance components: direct additive (sigma(Ao)(2)) and environmental (sigma(Eo)(2)) variances; maternal additive (sigma(Am)(2)) and environmental (sigma(Em)(2)) variances; and the direct-maternal additive (sigma(ApAm)) and environmental (sigma(EoEm)) covariances. The structure of maternal inheritance differs among the 10 traits considered at four stages in the life cycle. Early in the life cycle, seed weight and embryo weight display substantial sigma(Am)(2), a negative sigma(AoAm), and a positive sigma(EoEm) Subsequently, cotyledon diameter displays sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) of roughly the same magnitude and negative sigma(AoAm). For fall rosettes, leaf number and length are best described by a Mendelian model. In the spring, leaf length displays maternal inheritance with significant sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) and a negative sigma(AoAm). All maternally inherited traits show significant negative sigma(AoAm). Predicted response to selection under maternal inheritance depends on sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) as well as sigma(AoAm). Negative sigma(AoAm) results in predicted responses in the opposite direction to selection for seed weight and embryo weight and predicted responses near zero for all subsequent maternally inherited traits. Maternal inheritance persists through the life cycle of this annual plant for a number of size-related traits and will alter the direction and rate of evolutionary response in this population.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that copper tolerance in Mimulus gurratus Fischer ex DC. is controlled by a single major gene and can be enhanced by a number of minor genes (or modifiers). Here we report the uptake of copper by three lines which all possessed the major tolerance gene but differed in the modifier genes: the major gene only (IT), the major gene plus increased (HT6) and decreased (LT6) modifiers. HT6 showed the highest copper tolerance and IT the lowest. Copper uptake was investigated at five copper concentrations and over 30 d to analyse the concentration of copper accumulated in roots and shoots and the partitioning of apoplastic and symplastic root copper. Significant differences were found for root copper concentration with the IT line accumulating the highest levels. Fifty-two per cent of the root copper in the IT line is symplastic and this increases to 60% in LT6 and 64% in HT6. Significant differences were recorded for shoot copper concentration with HT6 accumulating the highest and IT the lowest. At the highest external copper concentration the HT line accumulated nearly 800 mu g g(-1) in its shoot, approaching levels reported for copper hyperaccumulation. (C) 1997 Annals of Botany Company.},

	Abstract = {Previous work on M. guttatus suggested that nickel tolerance in copper mine populations may also be given by the genes for copper tolerance. It has been shown that copper tolerance in M. guttatus is controlled by a single major gene, plus a number of minor genes (or modifiers) which elevate copper tolerance. Crosses between nickel tolerant individuals from three families and non - tolerants showed that nickel tolerance in M. guttatus is heritable. In order to study the effects of the major copper tolerance gene on copper - nickel co - tolerance in M. guttatus, homozygous copper tolerant and non - tolerant lines were screened against nickel. Significant differences occur between these lines for copper, but were not found when analysed for nickel, indicating that copper - nickel tolerance is not governed by the major gene for copper tolerance. To test whether the minor genes for copper have a pleiotropic effect on nickel tolerance, five selection lines derived from three copper mines (Copperopolis, Penn and Quail) in Calaveras county, California, which vary in degree of tolerance to copper, by the presence or absence of minor copper genes, were also screened against nickel. Two out of three of the lines from Copperopolis showed elevated tolerance to nickel, but two further selection lines derived from Penn and Quail copper mines gave no indication of increased nickel tolerance. These results suggest that the minor genes for copper do not give tolerance to nickel. This was confirmed by the screening of modifier lines, in which modifiers for differing degrees of copper tolerance were inserted into a non - tolerant background. Genotypes possessing fewer copper modifiers yielded higher nickel tolerance than those genotypes which have a greater number of modifiers. Thus nickel tolerance in this species is heritable and under the control of different genes to those producing copper tolerance.},

	Abstract = {In the face of environmental change, species can evolve new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic conditions or move spatially to maintain existing physiological associations with particular climates that define each species' climatic niche. When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.},

We evaluated how the lack of conservation effort influences the extinction risk of African great apes. We compiled information on presence/absence of primary (law enforcement guards) and secondary (tourism, research) conservation activities and nongovernmental conservation organizations (NGOs) support for 109 RMAs over the last 20 years. Along with these data, we collected environmental and anthropogenic variables, including recent records of ape presence/absence for all RMAs. As expected, law enforcement as a primary activity was the best predictor of ape survival rather than tourism or research as secondary activities. Furthermore, long-term NGO support had a significant positive influence on ape persistence. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of evaluating the relative importance of different conservation activities, an important step towards more evidence-based approaches in ape conservation.},

	Abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in understanding the role of positive inter-specific interactions within ecology, and significant progress has been made both empirically and theoretically. Similarly, considerable progress has been made in improving our understanding of the mechanisms that limit species' ranges. In this contribution, we seek to understand the setting of species' borders when some species within the assemblage exhibit positive inter-specific interactions. We use a spatially explicit dual-lattice simulation model to explore the distribution of different interactions across environmental gradients. We first simulate community dynamics when there is either a gradient in reproductive rate or in mortality. We then consider what happens when gradients in reproduction and mortality run in parallel or perpendicular to one another. If the stress gradient impacts on reproductive potential, positive interactions are found where there is high abiotic stress. In this instance, the mutualists are able to tolerate an environment that the cheaters cannot. However, when the stress gradient influences mortality, we find that the mutualists occur as a stripe surrounded by cheaters both towards the better and the harsher ends of the gradient. Previous theory and most empirical evidence tend to indicate that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. However, evidence from some stress gradients suggests that the distribution of positive and negative interactions can be more complex, with the most stressful environments being occupied by individuals engaging in negative rather than positive interactions. Our results provide a potential theoretical explanation for these recent field observation, and highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical work to better our understanding of how positive and negative interactions act to determine the limits to species' ranges.

	Abstract = {Lawns are a long-established component of domestic gardens but could now become a vehicle by which climate change becomes 'real' for many urban and suburbanised people. Within this context, field trials were set up on lawns in Cambridge University Botanic Garden with replicate plots having combinations of induced warming to +3 degrees C and drought conditions together with varying fertiliser and grass clippings managements. Lawn resilience was assessed using a chroma meter to measure browning and greening. All replicate plots recovered to pre-drought green colour after a 3-month induced summer drought. The use of fertiliser in spring lead to greater susceptibility to browning during drought and slower recovery but post-drought fertiliser application tended to aid recovery. Returning grass clippings to the surface led to an increased resistance to browning during drought, aided faster recovery and lowered levels of nitrate leaching. We conclude that under the conditions tested, the lawn plots showed a high degree of physical resilience which could be enhanced by management approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {A movement has begun recently to involve nonscientists in scientific investigations through projects in which a range of individuals gather data for use by scientists to investigate questions of research importance. These projects are frequently referred to as citizen-science projects, and the benefits are assumed to extend beyond the production of important large databases. Those who argue in support of citizen-science projects assume that participants will increase their understanding about the process of science through this engagement in authentic science, in contrast to traditional, rightly scripted school laboratory investigations. However, very little research on the impact of participating in such projects has been carried our. This article examines the letters written by more than 700 participants in a citizen-science project conducted by the Cornell Laboratory of Omithology. Of these letters, which were unsolicited and not connected with a formal evaluation, nearly 80% revealed that participants had engaged in thinking processes similar to those that are part of science investigations. We cannot state that participation in a citizen-science project caused this thinking, but we can say that participation provided a forum in which participants engaged in these habits of thought, The letters also raise some issues about some misunderstandings of science that citizen-science projects should strive to address.

	Abstract = {1 Increased occurrence of high-flow events as a result of climate change may affect the dispersal success of an invasive plant species Mimulus guttatus and may result in range expansion. Predicted changes in climate point to a continuation of the recent observed trends in increased precipitation and high-flow events in Northern Europe. 2 The study focused on the dispersal characteristics of M. guttatus, and especially the roles of vegetative fragmentation with increasing water velocities, subsequent fragment survival, regeneration and colonization, as well as the buoyancy, survival and germination success of seeds. 3 M. guttatus was found to fragment readily under velocities typical of high flow conditions and even small fragments had high survival, regeneration and colonization capacity. 4 Large numbers of small (< 0.02 mg) seeds are produced; however, seeds have a short buoyancy period so the timing and magnitude of high-flow events is crucial in determining potential dispersal distances. Seeds germinate readily both in water and on sand with an average 33% germination within 9 days. 5 The dual strategy of dispersal by vegetative fragments and seeds, together with the opportunity of dispersing the two types of propagules during different periods of the year, facilitates local dominance by M. guttatus as well as long-distance colonization. As a result, the rate of spread of M. guttatus into inundation communities along rivers is likely to increase with more frequent high-flow events, especially if these coincide with the growing season. Thus, predicting the response of riparian invasive species to environmental change requires not only an understanding of the role of climate in plant demography but also the impact of changes in hydrology on rates of spread.},

	Abstract = {Despite considerable interest in the dynamics of populations subject to temporally varying environments, alternate population growth rates and their sensitivities remain incompletely understood. For a Markovian environment, we compare and contrast the meanings of the stochastic growth rate (lambda(s)), the growth rate of l S average population (lambda(M)), the growth rate for average transition rates (lambda(A)), and the growth rate of an aggregate represented by a megamatrix (shown here to equal). We distinguish these growth rates by the averages that define them. We illustrate our results using data on an understory shrub in a hurricane-disturbed landscape, employing a range of hurricane frequencies. We demonstrate important differences among growth rates: lambda(s) lambda(M). We show that stochastic elasticity, E-ij(s), and megamatrix elasticity, E-ij(M), describe a complex perturbation of both means and variances of rates by the same proportion. Megamatrix elasticities respond slightly and stochastic elasticities respond strongly to changing the frequency of disturbance in the habitat ( in our example, the frequency of hurricanes). The elasticity E-ij(A) of lambda(A) does not predict changes in the other elasticities. Because, although commonly utilized, is difficult to interpret, we introduce elasticities with a more direct interpretation: E-Smu for perturbations of means and E-Ssigma for variances. We argue that a fundamental tool for studying selection pressures in varying environments is the response of growth rate to vital rates in all habitat states.},

	Abstract = {Senescence is characterized by a decline in survival, fecundity and reproductive value with age among adult individuals. Simple age-dependent life cycles progress forward through developmental stages, with each successive stage being characterized by age-specific vital rates. In contrast, size- or stage-based life cycles for perennial plants are more complex and often include stasis and retrogression to previous vegetative or reproductive life stages, indicating possible slowing or even reversing the developmental progress. Many plants remain in nonemergent, below-ground stages during the growing season (prolonged dormancy), which may affect the process of senescence. Stasis in the dormant stage implies that senescence is interrupted while plants are below-ground. We explored the underlying assumptions of size- or stage-based life cycle graphs and developed four different demographic models for how prolonged dormancy may mediate the relationship between age and vital rates. We then tested these models using more than 20years of demographic data on 2 perennial herbs, Astragalus scaphoides and Silene spaldingii. Results from model fitting suggest that prolonged dormancy interacts with the age dependence of vital rates. The model using true biological age (time since germination) of emergent and dormant plants to estimate vital rates was never the best model for our data. For both species, the model assuming that dormancy resets plants to the same postdormant state experienced earlier in life independent of their predormant age resulted in the best fit, though not for every vital rate. Older Astragalus plants had declining annual survival probabilities and reproductive value, suggesting senescence. Silene showed the opposite pattern for reproductive value that increased with age, indicating negative senescence. Synthesis. Using long-term demographic data from two perennial herbs, this study shows mixed evidence for senescence in perennial plants. Our results indicate that prolonged dormancy interacts with the age dependence of vital rates and may sometimes retard the process of senescence.},

	Abstract = {The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site. We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm-index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached. Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80% of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant-pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.},

	Abstract = {Two opposing patterns of meta-community organization are nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. Both patterns can be quantified with metrics that are applied to presence-absence matrices and tested with null model analysis. Previous meta-analyses have given conflicting results, with the same set of matrices apparently showing high nestedness (Wright et al. 1998) and negative species co-occurrence (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). We clarified the relationship between nestedness and co-occurrence by creating random matrices, altering them systematically to increase or decrease the degree of nestedness or co-occurrence, and then testing the resulting patterns with null models. Species co-occurrence is related to the degree of nestedness, but the sign of the relationship depends on how the test matrices were created. Low-fill matrices created by simple, uniform sampling generate negative correlations between nestedness and co-occurrence: negative species co-occurrence is associated with disordered matrices. However, high-fill matrices created by passive sampling generate the opposite pattern: negative species co-occurrence is associated with highly nested matrices. The patterns depend on which index of species co-occurrence is used, and they are not symmetric: systematic changes in the co-occurrence structure of a matrix are only weakly associated with changes in the pattern of nestedness. In all analyses, the fixed-fixed null model that preserves matrix row and column totals has lower type I and type II error probabilities than an equiprobable null model that relaxes row and column totals. The latter model is part of the popular nestedness temperature calculator, which detects nestedness too frequently in random matrices (type I statistical error). When compared to a valid null model, a matrix with negative species co-occurrence may be either highly nested or disordered, depending on the biological processes that determine row totals (number of species occurrences) and column totals (number of species per site).},

	Abstract = {We report measurements of rates of sap flow in dominant trees, changes in soil moisture, and evaporation from coarse woody debris in an old-growth Douglas-fir-western hemlock ecosystem at Wind River, Washington, USA, during dry periods in summer. The measurements are compared with eddy-covariance measurements of water-vapor fluxes above the forest (E-e) and at the forest floor (E-u) to examine the components of ecosystem water loss and the factors controlling them. Daily values of E-u were about 10% of E-e. Evaporation from coarse woody debris was only about 2% of E-e. Transpiration (E-t), estimated by scaling sap-flow measurements accounted for about 70% of (E-e- E-u); transpiration from subdominant trees may account for the remainder. The daily total change in soil moisture (E-s) in the top 30 cm was larger than the net change, probably because of hydraulic redistribution of soil water by roots. Observed differences between E-s and E-e were probably because roots also extract water from greater depth, and/or because the measuring systems sample at different spatial scales. The ratio of E-t to E-s decreased with decreasing soil water content, suggesting that partitioning in water use between understory and overstory changed during the season. The rate of soil drying exceeded E-e early in the day, probably because water vapor was being stored in canopy air space and condensed or adsorbed on tree stems, lichens, and mosses. The daily variation of E-e with vapor-pressure deficit showed strong hysteresis, most likely associated with transpiration of water stored in tree stems and branches.},

	Abstract = {Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e. g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences.},

	Abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change.},

	Abstract = {Several evolutionary hypotheses help explain why only some species adapt readily to new conditions and expand distributions beyond borders, but there is limited evidence testing these hypotheses. In this study, we consider patterns of neutral (microsatellite) and quantitative genetic variation in traits in three species of Drosophila from the montium species group in eastern Australia. We found little support for restricted or asymmetrical gene flow in any species. In rainforest-restricted Drosophila birchii, there was evidence of selection for increased desiccation and starvation resistance towards the southern border, and a reduction in genetic diversity in desiccation resistance at this border. No such patterns existed for Drosophila bunnanda, which has an even more restricted distribution. In the habitat generalist Drosophila serrata, there was evidence for geographic selection for wing size and development time, although clinal patterns for increased cold and starvation resistance towards the southern border could not be differentiated from neutral expectations. These findings suggest that borders in these species are not limited by low overall genetic variation but instead in two of the species reflect patterns of selection and genetic variability in key traits limiting borders.},

	Abstract = {The optimal allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction as well as the optimal values of other life-history characteristics such as phenology, growth and mating system are likely to depend on the life-cycle of the organism. I tested whether plants of Mimulus guttatus originating from temporarily wet populations where the species has an enforced annual life-cycle have higher allocation to sexual reproduction, lower allocation to vegetative reproduction, more rapid phenology, faster growth, and floral traits associated with a self-fertilizing mating system than plants from permanently wet populations where the species has a perennial life-cycle. I grew a total of 1377 plants originating from three populations with an annual life-cycle and 11 populations with a perennial life-cycle in a greenhouse under permanently and temporarily wet conditions. Plants of M. guttatus in permanently wet conditions had significantly more vegetative reproduction and tended to have a faster growth than plants in the temporarily wet conditions, indicating plasticity in these life-history traits. Plants from populations with an annual life-cycle invested significantly more in sexual reproduction and significantly less in vegetative reproduction than the ones from populations with a perennial life-cycle. Moreover, this study showed that plants originating from populations with an annual life-cycle have a significantly faster development and floral traits associated with autonomous self-fertilization. In conclusion, this study suggests that there has been adaptive evolution of life history traits of M. guttatus in response to natural watering conditions that determine the life span of the species.},

	Abstract = {Similar to the process seen in invasion biology, urbanized environments lead to biotic homogenization with a few species, often alien, dominating the urban habitat. We investigated avian communities across an urban gradient in Pretoria (South Africa). We defined three urbanization zones: urban, suburban and semi-natural, based on land-cover. We conducted point counts of all species at each of 13 sites in these zones over a 4-month period. We found significantly more species in the semi-natural zone than the urban zone but abundance was significantly lower in semi-natural than urban. The increase in abundance was mainly as a result of alien species with the three most abundant species in the urban zone being all alien. Semi-natural contained fewer alien species than urban and significantly fewer than suburban. The Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was the only alien species that was observed in all three urbanization zones and was the second most abundant species in the suburban and urban zones. Our study supports the process of biotic homogenization, where an increase in alien species occurs in the urban compared to semi-natural zone. Although the suburban zone made an important contribution towards native bird abundance in a larger city environment, this environment was also an important environment for alien species, especially for the Common Myna.

	Abstract = {Aim This study aims to evaluate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the realized and the ex-situ niches of four selected Rhododendron tree species. If the hypothesis is rejected, the aim is: (1) to evaluate whether the magnitude of discrepancy between the two types of niche is related to competition or external constraint, and (2) to identify which niche dimension is expanded (cold and/or warm limits) and to discuss it in relation to the assumption behind the biogeographical projections related to global warming. Location The four target species (Rhododendron arboreum Sm., R. campanulatum D. Don, R. barbatum Wall., and R. wallichi Sm.) are common evergreen broad-leaved trees in the central Himalayas. Their realized niches are based on data from the elevation-temperature gradient in Nepal (1000-5000 m a.s.l.). The ex-situ data are from botanical gardens and arboreta mainly located in the northern hemisphere (n=43). Method Binary data on these taxa were obtained from 707 geocoded herbarium specimens (elevation and UTM location) and from two elevation transects in Nepal (n =194 plots). Climate conditions from ex-situ locations for each taxon were compared with their realized climate ranges with respect to (i) mean annual temperature (MAT), (ii) mean minimum temperature of the coldest month (MINCM), (iii) mean maximum temperature of the warmest month (MAXWM), and (iv) moisture index (MI). Realized optima were estimated by Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and its non-parametric extension, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), were used to estimate the realized niches. Results All target species have ex-situ individuals outside the realized climate niche, but the number is much higher for maximum and minimum variables than for MAT. The most dominant species (in-situ ), R. arboreum, had very few individuals outside its realized range, indicating congruence between its ex-situ and realized niches. The other taxa had many individuals outside the warm end of their realized temperature ranges, but almost none beyond the cold end of their ranges. All target taxa occur in common gardens under warm temperate conditions, but only R. arboreum grows in the warm temperate zone in the Himalayas. This trend at the warm end of the gradient is interpreted as a result of biotic exclusion. Main conclusion The results demonstrate that an extreme cold temperature may represent an absolute boundary for tree species' survival, whereas warm temperatures do not. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that several tree species may survive global warming in-situ because of high temperature tolerance, but its effect on regeneration is uncertain. In lieu of this there may be a significant time lag between change in climate and transient tree species distribution. Thus the effect of global warming on tree species distribution may be very difficult to predict.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to observe the dynamics of a meta-population of Mimulus guttatus. Changes in size and location of 16 original populations and the new populations established in their vicinities in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake County, Utah, were observed for 25 yr. Twenty-three new populations appeared. Seven original populations and 13 new populations had become extinct by the end of the observation period in 1996. Many populations died out and were reestablished, often repeatedly, during the observation period. Altogether there were 54 population disappearances and 34 reappearances. Many populations changed size as much as 100-fold or more from year to year. There were spectacular examples of populations expanding to fill newly available, large habitats. Frequent extinctions were due overwhelmingly to the canyon drying trend, which led to the drying up of most Mill D North drainage springs, creeks, and ponds. Precipitation and minimum temperatures increased moderately during the observation period. The growing season lengthened almost 50%, a typical consequence of global warming. The drying trend, lengthened growing season; and disappearance of Mimulus populations in Big Cottonwood Canyon appear to be a clear, local example of global warming.},

	Abstract = {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity. The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod. Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions. Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient.},

	Abstract = {Vulnerability, adaptation and resilience are concepts that are finding increasing currency in several fields of research as well as in various policy and practitioner communities engaged in global environmental change science, climate change, sustainability science, disaster risk-reduction and famine interventions. As scientists and practitioners increasingly work together in this arena a number of questions are emerging: What is credible, salient and legitimate knowledge, how is this knowledge generated and how is it used in decision making? Drawing on important science in this field, and including a case study from southern Africa, we suggest an alternative mode of interaction to the usual one-way interaction between science and practice often used. In this alternative approach, different experts, risk-bearers, and local communities are involved and knowledge and practice is contested, co-produced and reflected upon. Despite some successes in the use and negotiation of such knowledge for 'real' world issues, a number of problems persist that require further investigation including the difficulties of developing consensus on the methodologies used by a range of stakeholders usually across a wide region (as the case study of southern Africa shows, particularly in determining and identifying vulnerable groups, sectors, and systems); slow delivery of products that could enhance resilience to change that reflects not only a lack of data, and need for scientific credibility, but also the time-consuming process of coming to a negotiated understanding in science-practice interactions and, finally, the need to clarify the role of 'external' agencies, stakeholders, and scientists at the outset of the dialogue process and subsequent interactions. Such factors, we argue, all hinder the use of vulnerability and resilience 'knowledge' that is being generated and will require much more detailed investigation by both producers and users Of Such knowledge.

	Abstract = {Modern urban development provides an excellent laboratory for examining the interplay among socioecological relationships. We analyzed how the rapidly urbanizing Phoenix, Arizona metropolis has affected plant species diversity and community composition at a regional scale. Species diversity and plant density probably result from abiotic sorting in undeveloped desert sites, but not in urban sites. We found that species richness at the plot scale was higher for desert as opposed to urban sites; however, the estimated total species pool in the urban ecosystem is higher than that in the desert, as a result of the increased importation of introduced species through the nursery trade. Ordination of plant communities suggests three unique groupings of species based on land-use type of the site (desert, urban, and agriculture) and two unique groupings of urban sites based on landscaping aesthetics (mesic or xeric). We therefore recognize both bottom-up and top-down controls of plant biodiversity within the urban ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Although the effects of climate change on biodiversity are increasingly evident by the shifts in species ranges across taxonomical groups, the underlying mechanisms affecting individual species are still poorly understood. The power of climate envelopes to predict future ranges has been seriously questioned in recent studies. Amongst others, an improved understanding of the effects of current weather on population trends is required. We analysed the relation between butterfly abundance and the weather experienced during the life cycle for successive years using data collected within the framework of the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme for 40 species over a 15-year period and corresponding climate data. Both average and extreme temperature and precipitation events were identified, and multiple regression was applied to explain annual changes in population indices. Significant weather effects were obtained for 39 species, with the most frequent effects associated with temperature. However, positive density-dependence suggested climatic independent trends in at least 12 species. Validation of the short-term predictions revealed a good potential for climate-based predictions of population trends in 20 species. Nevertheless, data from the warm and dry year of 2003 indicate that negative effects of climatic extremes are generally underestimated for habitat specialists in drought-susceptible habitats, whereas generalists remain unaffected. Further climatic warming is expected to influence the trends of 13 species, leading to an improvement for nine species, but a continued decline in the majority of species. Expectations from climate envelope models overestimate the positive effects of climate change in northwestern Europe. Our results underline the challenge to include population trends in predicting range shifts in response to climate change.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of warming for 6 years on growth, and needle carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll, and carbohydrate levels in a coniferous tree species, Abies faxoniana. Seedlings were grown in even-aged monospecific stands under ambient and warming (ambient + 2.2 degrees C) temperature in climate control chambers. Warming caused statistically significant increases in the specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, root biomass, leaf biomass, branch biomass, stem biomass, and total mass of the seedlings, and reduced the root/shoot ratio. Warming also increased total chlorophyll concentrations, specific chlorophyll pigments, and Chlorophyll a/b ratios in both studied needle age classes. In addition, C/N ratios of current-year and 1-year-old needles increased by warming. In contrast, warming decreased the levels of N, sugar, cellulose, and starch in needles, while warming had no effect on the height, stem diameter, needle mass ratio, root mass ratio, and root/needle ratio. We conclude that warming increases branch growth and changes needle chemistry, which enhances the light capture potential of seedlings.},

	Abstract = {Background: Around the world, researchers are using the observations and experiences of citizens to describe patterns in animal populations. This data is often collected via ongoing sampling or by synthesizing past experiences. Since elasmobranchs are relatively rare, obtaining data for broad-scale trend analysis requires high sampling effort. Elasmobranchs are also relatively large and conspicuous and therefore it may be possible to enlist recreational divers to collect data on their occurrence and relative abundance from daily dive activities. For this, however, a good understanding of the value of data collected by recreational divers is essential. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we explore the value of recreational divers for censusing elasmobranchs using a diverse set of data sources. First, we use a simulation experiment to explore detection rates of the roving diver technique, used by recreational divers, across a range of fish densities and speeds. Next, using a field survey, we show that inexperienced recreational divers detect and count elasmobranchs as well as experienced recreational divers. Finally, we use semi-structured interviews of recreational dive instructors to demonstrate the value of their recollections in terms of effort and their descriptions of spatial and temporal distributions of sharks in Thailand. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, this study provides initial ground-work for using recreational divers for monitoring elasmobranch populations. If used appropriately, citizen-collected data may provide additional information that can be used to complement more standardized surveys and to describe population trends across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Due to the non-extractive nature of this data, recreational divers may also provide important insight into the success of conservation initiatives, such as shark sanctuaries and no-take zones.},

	Abstract = {Recent concerns about changing elasmobranch populations have prompted the need to understand their patterns of distribution and abundance through non-destructive sampling methods. Since scientific divers represent a small portion of the total number of divers worldwide, the use of nonscientific divers could drastically increase the number of observations needed to monitor broad-scale, long-term trends. Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species. In total, yellow stingrays were observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7% sighting frequency) with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2007-a standardized decline rate of -0.11. However, these trends were not consistent in all regions. The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions. Our results suggest large-scale changes in yellow stingray abundance that have been unnoticed by the scientific community. Thus, our study highlights the value of non-scientific divers for collecting data that can be used to understand population trends of otherwise poorly studied species.},

	Abstract = {Ecosystem fragmentation and destruction can lead to restrictive administration policies on traditional harvesting by indigenous peoples from remaining ecosystem tracts. In New Zealand, concerns about endangered species and governmental policies that focus on species and ecosystem preservation have resulted in severely curtailed traditional harvesting rights. Although provision has been made for limited gathering of traditional plants from government-administered conservation lands, it is unclear how much harvesting is undertaken on these lands and elsewhere and what this harvest might consist of. We interviewed seven expert Maori elders from the Waikato, New Zealand, to identify plant species they currently harvested and from where. We compared these data with the data we collected on permits issued for plant collecting on conservation lands in the same region. We sought to gain information on indigenous plant harvesting to determine the extent of permitted harvesting from conservation lands in the Waikato and to identify issues that might affect plant harvesting and management. Elders identified 58 species they harvest regularly or consider culturally important; over 50% of these species are harvested for medicinal use. Permit data from 1996 to 2006 indicated no apparent relationship between species of reported cultural significance and the number of permits issued for each of these species. Currently, few plant species are harvested from conservation lands, although some unofficial harvesting occurs. Elders instead reported that medicinal plants are frequently collected from urban and other public areas. They reported that plant species used for dyeing, carving, and weaving are difficult to access. Elders also discussed concerns such as spraying of roadsides, which resulted in the death of medicinal species, and use of commercial hybrids in urban planning. Local government may have an increasingly important role in supporting native traditions through urban planning, which takes account of cultural harvesting needs while potentially reducing future harvesting pressure on conservation lands. We suggest that active participation by the Maori community in the development and management of urban harvesting resources will result in positive outcomes.},

	Abstract = {The contemporary genetic structure of species offers key imprints of how organisms responded to past geological and climatic events, which have played a crucial role in shaping the current geographical distribution of north-temperate organisms. In this study, range-wide patterns of genetic variation were examined in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a dominant forest tree species distributed from Mexico to British Columbia in western North America. Two organelle DNA markers with contrasting modes of inheritance were genotyped for 613 individuals from 44 populations. Two mitotypes and 42 chlorotypes were recovered in this survey. Both genomes showed significant population subdivision, indicative of limited gene flow through seeds and pollen. Three distinct cpDNA lineages corresponding to the Pacific Coast, the Rocky Mountains, and Mexico were observed. The split time of the two lineages from the Rockies lineage was dated back to 8.5 million years (Ma). The most recent common ancestors of Mexican and coastal populations were estimated at 3.2 and 4.8 Ma, respectively. The northern populations of once glaciated regions were characterized by a high level of genetic diversity, indicating a large zone of contact between ancestral lineages. A possible northern refugium was also inferred. The Mexican lineage, which appeared established by southward migration from the Rockies lineage, was characterized by the lowest genetic diversity but highest population differentiation. These results suggest that the effects of Quaternary climatic oscillations on the population dynamics and genetic diversity of Douglas-fir varied substantially across the latitudinal section. The results emphasize the pressing need for the conservation of Mexican Douglas-fir.},

	Abstract = {One of the most fundamental problems in monitoring animal populations is that of imperfect detection. Although imperfect detection can be modeled, studies examining patterns in occurrence often ignore detection and thus fail to properly partition variation in detection from that of occurrence. In this study, we used anuran calling survey data collected on North American Amphibian Monitoring Program routes in eastern Maryland to investigate factors that influence detection probability and site occupancy for 10 anuran species. In 2002, 17 calling survey routes in eastern Maryland were surveyed to collect environmental and species data nine or more times. To analyze these data, we developed models incorporating detection probability and site occupancy. The results suggest that, for more than half of the 10 species, detection probabilities vary most with season (i.e., day-of-year), air temperature, time, and moon illumination, whereas site occupancy may vary by the amount of palustrine forested wetland habitat. Our results suggest anuran calling surveys should document air temperature, time of night, moon illumination, observer skill, and habitat change over time, as these factors can be important to model-adjusted estimates of site occupancy. Our study represents the first formal modeling effort aimed at developing an analytic assessment framework for NAAMP calling survey data.},

	Abstract = {Geographic limits of species are commonly associated with climatic or physical boundaries, but the mechanisms of exclusion at the limits of distribution are poorly understood. In sonic intertidal populations, the strengths of interactions with natural enemies are mediated by microclimate, and determine geographic limits. The northern limit of the barnacle Chthamalus fragilis in New England is the south side of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. South of the cape, Chthamalus has a refuge from competition in (lie high intertidal, which is too hot for survival of its superior competitor Semibalanus balanoides. North of the cape. the high intertidal is cooler, and Semibalanus survives, so Chthamalus has no refuge. Thus, geographic variation in the strength of competition may determine the geographic limit of Chthamalus. Intolerance or cold by, Chthamalus cannot account for the geographic limit: transplants of Chthamalus 80 kill beyond its northern limit survived up to 8 yr in the absence of competition with Semibalanus. At the geographic limit of Chthamalus in the Cape Cod Canal there are two bridges, 5 km apart. On the southern bridge, Chthamalus is abundant and occupies a refuge above Semibalanus. Oil the northern bridge in 2001, only, 7 individual Chthamalus were present. Despite the proximity of the bridges, their microclimates are very different. The southern bridge, where Chthamalus is abundant, is up to WC hotter than the northern bridge. This higher temperature creates a refuge in the high intertidal for Chthamalus. On the cooler northern bridge, there is no refuge for Chthamalus. Because of the difference in temperatures of the water masses that meet in the canal, heat storage in the rock of the bridge piers causes the temperatures to differ between the bridges. Thus, geographic change in microclimate alters the strength of competition, and determines the geographic limit. "When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see sonic species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change in climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a very false view: we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food, and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease."-Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, 1859, p. 69.},

	Abstract = {Program MARK provides > 100 models for the estimation of population parameters from mark-encounter data. The multistate model of Brownie et al. (1993) and Hestbecket al. (1991) allows animals to move between states with a probability of transition. The simplest multistate model is an extension of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) live recapture model. Parameters estimated are state-specific survival rates and encounter probabilities and transition probabilities between states. The multistate model provides a valuable framework to evaluate important ecological questions. For example, estimation of state-specific survival and transition probabilities between the biological states of breeders and nonbreeders allows estimation of the cost of reproduction. Transitions between physical states, such as spatial areas, provide estimates needed for meta-population models. The basic multistate model uses only live recaptures, but 3 extensions are included in MARK. A multistate model with live and dead encounters is available, although the dead encounters are not state specific. Robust-design multistate models are also included in MARK, with both open and closed robust designs. These models assume that animals move between states only between primary sessions of the robust design. For the closed robust design, we can specify 12 different data types for the modeling of encounter probabilities during the primary session, including 6 versions of the closed model likelihood incorporating population size (N) directly in the likelihood, and 6 versions of the Huggins model in which N is estimated as a derived parameter outside the likelihood. One assumption that is generally necessary to estimate state-specific survival rates in the multistate model is that transitions take place immediately before encounter occasions. Otherwise, survival rates over the interval between encounter occasions are a mix of survival rates over multiple states. Advantages of using MARK to estimate the parameters of the various multistate models include flexibility of model specification to include group, time, and individual covariates, estimation of variance components, model averaging of parameter estimates, and Bayesian parameter estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures on the logit scale.},

Inferences about differences in means among treatments as well as the dispersion of the counts are possible. Simulations demonstrated that the statistical power of ANOVA is about the same as the likelihood-ratio testing procedure for testing equality of means, but our proposed testing procedure also provides information on dispersion.

We focus specifically on how niche conservatism in climatic tolerances may limit geographic range expansion and how this one type of niche conservatism may be important in (a) allopatric speciation, (b) historical biogeography, (c) patterns of species richness, (d) community structure, (e) the spread of invasive, human-introduced species, (f) responses of species to global climate change, and (g) human history, from 13,000 years ago to the present.

	Abstract = {In this paper, I review the relevance of the niche to biogeography, and what biogeography may tell us about the niche. The niche is defined as the combination of abiotic and biotic conditions where a species can persist. I argue that most biogeographic patterns are created by niche differences over space, and that even 'geographic barriers' must have an ecological basis. However, we know little about specific ecological factors underlying most biogeographic patterns. Some evidence supports the importance of abiotic factors, whereas few examples exist of large-scale patterns created by biotic interactions. I also show how incorporating biogeography may offer new perspectives on resource-related niches and species interactions. Several examples demonstrate that even after a major evolutionary radiation within a region, the region can still be invaded by ecologically similar species from another clade, countering the long-standing idea that communities and regions are generally 'saturated' with species. I also describe the somewhat paradoxical situation where competition seems to limit trait evolution in a group, but does not prevent co-occurrence of species with similar values for that trait (called here the 'competition-divergence-co-occurrence conundrum'). In general, the interface of biogeography and ecology could be a major area for research in both fields.},

	Abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

TSFF stakeholders helped identify specific objectives and alternative management strategies for the fishery at a time when new management strategies were under consideration. A metapopulation and fishing simulation model was used to evaluate alternative management strategies related to harvest and conservation of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the main target species. Stakeholders identified objectives relating to conservation of un-fished populations, maintenance of harvestable stock, and economic performance. In terms of management options, spatial closures decreased the prospects of meeting nearly all stakeholder objectives. A seasonal closure and larger minimum capture size increased the probability of meeting conservation and harvest objectives, but decreased the probability of meeting most economic objectives for both sectors. Increasing fishing effort increased harvest but decreased the catch rates for both sectors, so had varied effects on the probability of achieving harvest objectives. The research provides a case study of productive engagement with indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders to address fisheries management needs and provides a framework for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management strategies against stakeholder objectives.},

Such a method must complement more intensive sampling methods inclusive of molecular cytogenetics, proteomics and genomics. We developed a new method for marking live Pinus taeda pollen using two dyes, rhodamine 123 and aniline blue, dissolved in a sucrose solution. Marked and unmarked pollen were compared with respect to in vitro germination, storage, terminal velocity, and in vivo pollen tube penetration of ovules. We found that: (1) both types of marked pollen retained their capacity for germination, (2) both types of marked pollen had similar aerodynamic properties when compared to unmarked pollen controls, (3) marked pollen retained its germination capacity for 48 h, and (4) of the marked pollen, only the aniline-marked pollen penetrated ovules during pollination. Germination declined rapidly for both types of marked pollen after 48 h and before 37 days at -20A degrees C storage, while unmarked pollen lots retained 93% germination at all stages. This method for marking live P. taeda pollen is feasible for tracing LDD pollen only if released and deposited within 48 h of dye treatment.},

Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species. Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) have historically increased in abundance. The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response, however, remains untested. We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long-term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord, Massachusetts (USA). Our results demonstrate that non-native species, and invasive species in particular, have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time. This demonstrates that climate change has likely played, and may continue to play, an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level.},

The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans approximate to 150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response. Species that do not respond to temperature have decreased greatly in abundance, and include among others anemones and buttercups [Ranunculaceae pro parte (p.p.)], asters and campanulas (Asterales), bluets (Rubiaceae p.p.), bladderworts (Lentibulariaceae), dogwoods (Cornaceae), lilies (Liliales), mints (Lamiaceae p.p.), orchids (Orchidaceae), roses (Rosaceae p.p.), saxifrages (Saxifragales), and violets (Malpighiales).

	Abstract = {When populations are partially inbred due to the population structure or to a mixed mating system like partial self-fertilization, some individuals will be more inbred than others. This heterogeneity among individuals in the history of inbreeding can greatly complicate the interpretation of measures of quantitative genetic variability when the traits studied exhibit inbreeding depression. Partial inbreeding can also bias measures of phenotypic selection toward the detection of strong directional and stabilizing selection. In this paper, data are presented from several inbreeding experiments conducted on two partially selfing, annual populations of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus that show that the means of many of the morphological and phenological traits measured were affected by inbreeding. These findings imply that estimates of heritabilities and additive genetic covariances would not reflect the potential for these populations to respond to selection. Phenotypic selection analyses conducted on naturally occurring plants, involving linear regressions of relative seed production on the traits, revealed significant directional selection on many of the same quantitative traits measured in the inbreeding studies. However, when the same selection analyses were performed on plants with known histories of inbreeding, part of the statistical relationship between relative seed number and the traits was found to be due to the mating system: inbred individuals had both lower seed production and different mean values for the traits than outcrossed individuals. It is also shown, with a hypothetical example, that partial inbreeding can bias measures of stabilizing selection toward the detection of strong stabilizing selection. Partial inbreeding therefore tends to make directional and stabilizing selection appear stronger than it is, and it may be that natural selection in the wild is actually weaker than many studies of partially inbred species suggest.},

	Abstract = {Recent theoretical work has shown that there can be selection favoring the maintenance of sexual reproduction and the evolution of increased recombination when deleterious mutations at different loci interact synergistically, such that the logarithm of fitness declines at a greater than linear rate with the number of harmful mutations per genome. The purpose of this experimental study was to determine whether synergism exists for genes affecting fitness components in two partially selfing populations of the monkey flower Mimulus guttatus. For each wild population, a large randomly mated base population was constructed and many independent lines, inbred to differing degrees, were extracted from this base population. Lines with expected inbreeding coefficients of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 were raised simultaneously in the greenhouse and were scored for germination, flowering, flower production, and pollen viability. All fitness traits except germination success declined with increased inbreeding, but in spite of the substantial inbreeding depression found in this study, relatively little evidence of synergistic epistasis was found. The only trait that showed evidence of synergism was pollen viability. These results indicate that synergism is not strong for the fitness components measured in this study. The evidence for synergism from other published studies is also reviewed.},

	Abstract = {Inbreeding depression is likely to be a common selective force opposing the automatic selective advantage of self-fertilization in self-compatible plants and animals, yet relatively few studies have measured both the breeding system and inbreeding depression in natural populations. In this study, I estimated the frequency of selfing, using data obtained by gel electrophoresis, in two annual populations of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus for 2 years, and measured the relative performance of selfed and outcrossed progeny over several stages of the life cycle in both the field and the greenhouse. Rates of outcrossing were not significantly different from 1.0 in either population in 1989, but both populations exhibited significant and moderate amounts of selfing in 1990. Outcrossing rates were significantly different between years for the Cone Peak population but not for the Iron Mountain population. Significant inbreeding depression was detected for almost every component of fitness measured, including germination success, survival to flowering, and flower, fruit and seed production in the native field environments for both populations. The final cumulative value of inbreeding depression, calculated as one minus the relative total seed production of selfed to outcrossed progeny, was 0.69 for Iron Mountain and 0.64 for Cone Peak. Inbreeding depression was also severe in the greenhouse experiments, even though fitness components only up to flower production were measured: 0.52 for Iron Mountain and 0.48 for Cone Peak. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of the magnitude of inbreeding depression in primarily outcrossing populations, and indicate that inbreeding depression is an important factor in the maintenance of outcrossing in these populations.},

Using data presently available in the literature, I compare the slopes (on a log-linear scale) of seed shadows for plants with different morphologically characterized modes of dispersal. The seeds of many species have no evident morphological adaptation for dispersal and seem to achieve only short-distance dispersal. Seed shadows for herbaceous species with devices for wind have flatter slopes and more distant modes and maxima than those of ballists, which in turn exceed those with no special devices. Seed shadows for wind-dispersed trees and shrubs had similar or steeper slopes than those for vertebrate-dispersed species in this sample. Species with poor mechanisms for dispersal in space only sometimes had the capacity for better dispersal in time (dormancy). Although some species exhibited seed shadows sufficiently steep to be predicted to colonize new habitat in a 'front' or phalanx pattern, actual colonization patterns must reflect many other factors.},

	Abstract = {This report summarizes our current knowledge of leaf-level physiological processes that regulate carbon gain and water loss of the dominant tree species in an old-growth forest at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility. Analysis includes measurements of photosynthesis, respiration, stomatal conductance, water potential, stable carbon isotope values, and biogenic hydrocarbon emissions from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and western red cedar (Thuja plicata). Leaf-level information is used to scale fluxes up to the canopy to estimate gross primary production using a physiology-based process model. Both light-saturated and in situ photosynthesis exhibit pronounced vertical gradients through the canopy, but are consistently highest in Douglas-fir, intermediate in western hemlock, and lowest in western red cedar. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are strongly dependent on vapor-pressure deficit in Douglas-fir, and decline through the course of a seasonal drought. Foliar respiration is similar for Douglas-fir and western hemlock, and lowest for western red cedar. Water-use efficiency varied with species and tree height, as indexed using stable carbon isotopes values for foliage. Leaf water potential is most negative for Douglas-fir and similar for western hemlock and western red cedar. Terpene fluxes from foliage equal approximately 1% of the net carbon loss from the forest. Modeled estimates based on physiological measurements show gross primary productivity (GPP) to be about 22 Mg C m(-2) y(-1). Physiological studies will be necessary to further refine estimates of stand-level carbon balance and to make long-term predictions of changes in carbon balance due to changes in forest structure, species composition, and climate.},

	Abstract = {Premise of the study: The study of how phenology may contribute to the assembly of plant communities has a long history in ecology. Climate change has brought renewed interest in this area, with many studies examining how phenology may contribute to the success of exotic species. In particular, there is increasing evidence that exotic species occupy unique phenological niches and track climate change more closely than native species. Methods: Here, we use long-term records of species' first flowering dates from five northern hemisphere temperate sites (Chinnor, UK and in the United States, Concord, Massachusetts; Fargo, North Dakota; Konza Prairie, Kansas; and Washington, D. C.) to examine whether invaders have distinct phenologies. Using a broad phylogenetic framework, we tested for differences between exotic and native species in mean annual flowering time, phenological changes in response to temperature and precipitation, and longer-term shifts in first flowering dates during recent pronounced climate change ("flowering time shifts"). Key results: Across North American sites, exotic species have shifted flowering with climate change while native species, on average, have not. In the three mesic systems, exotic species exhibited higher tracking of interannual variation in temperature, such that flowering advances more with warming, than native species. Across the two grassland systems, however, exotic species differed from native species primarily in responses to precipitation and soil moisture, not temperature. Conclusions: Our findings provide cross-site support for the role of phenology and climate change in explaining species' invasions. Further, they support recent evidence that exotic species may be important drivers of extended growing seasons observed with climate change in North America.},

We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations.

Yet 63% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context.

However, increment coring is an invasive method that may result in tree decay and decreased physical stability of the cored tree. The long-term effects of coring on tree mortality are poorly understood for any tree species because long-term data sets are rare. We present results from a 40-year study on the effects of coring on tree mortality in a near-primary Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest in the Swiss Alps (forest reserve Scat le). In 1965-1966, 551 trees with a diameter at breast height >= 8 cm were cored within a 5.9 ha plot. Following a reassessment of the plot in 2006, we compared the mortality rates of the 551 trees cored in 1965 with those of similar trees from the uncored control group, i.e., trees that were similar in size (diameter at breast height), vitality, and forest layer class. Neither nonparametric tests nor logistic regression models indicate a significant influence of coring on tree mortality. Our results suggest that increment coring does not influence the mortality rate of P. abies within the study region. Additional studies in different environments and on different tree species are needed to evaluate the generality of our findings.},

The Yangtze Delta region has one of the highest rates of urbanization in China. In this study, carried out in Jiangyin County as a representative region within the Yangtze Delta, land use and land cover changes were estimated using Landsat TM and ETM + imagery. With these satellite data and the BEPS process model (Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator), the impacts of urbanization on regional net primary productivity (NPP) and annual net primary production were assessed for 1991 and 2002. Landsat-based land cover maps in 1991 and 2002 showed that urban development encroached large areas of cropland and forest. Expansion of residential areas and reduction of vegetated areas were the major forms of land transformation in Jiangyin County during this period. Mean NPP of the total area decreased from 8 18 to 699 g C m(-2) 2 yr(-1) during the period of 1991 to 2002. NPP of cropland was only reduced by 2.7% while forest NPP was reduced by 9.3%. Regional annual primary production decreased from 808 Gg C in 1991 to 691 Gg C in 2002, a reduction of 14.5%. Land cover changes reduced regional NPP directly, and the increasing intensity and frequency of human-induced disturbance in the urbanized areas could be the main reason for the decrease in forest NPP},

However, the current distributions of many species are unlikely to be at equilibrium with the current distribution of environmental conditions, both because of ongoing invasions and because the distribution of suitable environmental conditions is always changing. This mismatch between the equilibrium assumptions inherent in many analyses and the disequilibrium conditions in the real world leads to inaccurate predictions of species' geographic distributions and suggests the need for theory and analytical tools that avoid equilibrium assumptions. Here, we develop a general theory of environmental associations during periods of transient dynamics. We show that time-invariant relationships between environmental conditions and rates of local colonization and extinction can produce substantial temporal variation in occupancy?environment relationships. We then estimate occupancy?environment relationships during three avian invasions. Changes in occupancy?environment relationships over time differ among species but are predicted by dynamic occupancy models. Since estimates of the occupancy?environment relationships themselves are frequently poor predictors of future occupancy patterns, research should increasingly focus on characterizing how rates of local colonization and extinction vary with environmental conditions.},

	Abstract = {Drivers of biodiversity at macroscales have long been of interest in ecology, and climate and topography are now considered to be major drivers. Because humans have transformed most of the Earth's land surface, land use may play a significant role as a driver of biodiversity at a macroscale. Here we disentangle the relationships among climate, topography, land use, available energy (measured by the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]), and species richness of Japanese forest birds. Species richness was better explained at 40- and 80-km resolutions than at 5-, 10- and 20-km resolutions; it was explained by climate, topography, and land use, and the effects of land use were fully incorporated into those of climate and topography. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, natural forest area decreased, and this decrease intensified in warm lowland areas. With the loss of natural forest, species richness decreased below a certain threshold. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, species richness and NDVI increased slightly or were unchanged in cool highland areas and decreased in warm lowland areas. Species richness increased linearly with the increase in NDVI. Most effects of climate/topography on species richness in warm lowland areas were shared by those of land use, suggesting that the decrease in species richness in warm lowland areas has been caused by loss of natural forest. Therefore, it is suggested that climate and topography determined land use intensity, which in turn, drove species richness through the depletion of available energy. Increasing temperature and decreasing elevation leads to both benefits (increase in potential available energy) and costs (depletion of energy by human land-use change) for forest birds. These costs seem to override benefits in warm lowland areas.},

	Abstract = {For decades, numerous surveys have asked Americans the "Most Important Problem" (MIP) question: "What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?" Global warming and the environment have rarely been cited by more than a small number of respondents in these surveys in recent years, which might seem to suggest that these have not been the most important issues to Americans. This paper explores the possibility that an additional method of assessing the public's priorities might support a different conclusion. Three experiments embedded in national surveys (two done via the Internet, the other done by telephone) show that when asked the traditional MIP question, respondents rarely mentioned global warming or the environment, but when other respondents were asked to identify the most serious problem that will face the world in the future if nothing is done to stop it, global warming and the environment were the most frequently mentioned problems. Furthermore, a large majority of Americans indicated that they wanted the federal government to devote substantial effort to combating problems that the world will face in the future if nothing is done to stop them. Thus, future surveys might include both versions of the MIP question to more fully document Americans' priorities.},

	Abstract = {Genetic differentiation within a species' range is determined by natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. Selection and drift enhance genetic differences if populations are sufficiently isolated, while gene flow precludes differentiation and local adaptation. Over large geographical areas, these processes can create a variety of scenarios, ranging from admixture to a high degree of population differentiation. Genetic differences among populations may signal functional differences within a species' range, potentially leading to population or ecotype-specific responses to global change. We investigated differentiation within the geographical range of two butterfly species along a broad latitudinal gradient. This gradient is the primary axis of climatic variation, and many ecologists expect populations at the poleward edge of this gradient to expand under climate change. Our study species inhabit a shared ecosystem and differ in body size and resource specialization; both also find their poleward range limit on an island. We find evidence for divergence of peripheral populations from the core in both taxa, suggesting the potential for genetic distinctiveness at the leading edge of climate change. We also find differences between the species in the extent of peripheral differentiation with the smaller and more specialized species showing greater population divergence (microsatellites and mtDNA) and reduced gene flow (mtDNA). Finally, gene flow estimates in both species differed strongly between two marker types. These findings suggest caution in assuming that populations are invariant across latitude and thus will respond as a single ecotype to climatic change.},

In order to test this hypothesis, we used a novel time-lagged correlation analysis to look at times series data concerning nature participation, and evaluate its relationship with future conservation support (measured as contributions to conservation NGOs). Our results suggest that the type and timing of nature experience may determine future conservation investment. Time spent hiking or backpacking is correlated with increased conservation contributions 11-12 years later. On the other hand, contributions are negatively correlated with past time spent on activities such as public lands visitation or fishing. Our results suggest that each hiker or backpacker translates to $200-$300 annually in future NGO contributions. We project that the recent decline in popularity of hiking and backpacking will negatively impact conservation NGO contributions from approximately 2010-2011 through at least 2018.},

	Abstract = {The phenology of temperate plants is vulnerable to climate change. Yet, the phenological responses of tropical plants to climate change are still unclear. In this study, temporal trends (1973-1999) of four phenological events (budburst, growing season, flowering and flowering duration) were studied among 21 plant species in Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (south-western China). Fourteen species (67%) showed significant phenological trends during the study period. Seven species (33%) presented delaying trends in budburst (average 1.4 d y(-1)) and such trend was more likely to be presented in those that started budburst earlier in the dry season. Four species (19%) showed trends of extension in growing season (average of 3.5 d y(-1)). These vegetative events appeared to be mainly influenced by increasing temperature. Rainfall showed little effects directly, however, the effects of temperature seemed to largely depend on the moisture condition. Flowering duration of five species (24%) was shortened by average 2.1 d y(-1) which was most likely to be the result of the decline in sunshine duration during the rainy season. Our results suggest that the phenology of tropical plants has changed significantly in response to the regional climate change but these reactions are somewhat different from those of temperate plants.},

	Abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but current evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, offspring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipitation change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3%). Only 4.3% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When compared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no consistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

	Abstract = {Understanding niche evolution, dynamics, and the response of species to climate change requires knowledge of the determinants of the environmental niche and species range limits. Mean values of climatic variables are often used in such analyses. In contrast, the increasing frequency of climate extremes suggests the importance of understanding their additional influence on range limits. Here, we assess how measures representing climate extremes (i.e., interannual variability in climate parameters) explain and predict spatial patterns of 11 tree species in Switzerland. We find clear, although comparably small, improvement (+20% in adjusted D(2), +8% and +3% in cross-validated True Skill Statistic and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values) in models that use measures of extremes in addition to means. The primary effect of including information on climate extremes is a correction of local overprediction and underprediction. Our results demonstrate that measures of climate extremes are important for understanding the climatic limits of tree species and assessing species niche characteristics. The inclusion of climate variability likely will improve models of species range limits under future conditions, where changes in mean climate and increased variability are expected.},

Until recently, phenology, the study of periodic phenomena in plants and animals, has been limited in practice largely to observation of visible phenomena. The relationship of plant physiological processes to phenologicai events seems obvious, but physiological bases for many phenologicai events have yet to be uncovered. To an increasing extent this is now being done.},

@article{schwartz2014,
	Abstract = {Phenological observations offer a simple and effective way to measure climate change effects on the biosphere. While some species in northern mixed forests show a highly sensitive site preference to microenvironmental differences (i.e., the species is present in certain areas and absent in others), others with a more plastic environmental response (e.g., Acer saccharum, sugar maple) allow provisional separation of the universal ``background'' phenological variation caused by in situ (possibly biological/genetic) variation from the microclimatic gradients in air temperature. Moran's I tests for spatial autocorrelation among the phenological data showed significant ($\alpha${\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}0.05) clustering across the study area, but random patterns within the microclimates themselves, with isolated exceptions. In other words, the presence of microclimates throughout the study area generally results in spatial autocorrelation because they impact the overall phenological development of sugar maple trees. However, within each microclimate (where temperature conditions are relatively uniform) there is little or no spatial autocorrelation because phenological differences are due largely to randomly distributed in situ factors. The phenological responses from 2008 and 2009 for two sugar maple phenological stages showed the relationship between air temperature degree-hour departure and phenological change ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 days earlier for each additional 100 degree-hours. Further, the standard deviations of phenological event dates within individual microclimates (for specific events and years) ranged from 2.6 to 3.8 days. Thus, that range of days is inferred to be the ``background'' phenological variation caused by factors other than air temperature variations, such as genetic differences between individuals.},

	Abstract = {The close morphological and temporal links between phases of plant growth and reproduction call for integrated studies incorporating several reproductive phases from flowering to recruitment, and associated plant‐animal interactions. Phenological strategies, as well as plastic phenological response to climate change, incorporate complex interactions between developmental constraints, pollination and seed dispersal. Relationships between reproductive phenology and components of fitness were studied for two years in the north‐temperate, self‐incompatible, insect‐pollinated, and bird‐dispersed shrub Frangula alnus (Rhamnaceae). Fruit set, dispersal, germination and juvenile survival, as well as seed mass and juvenile size were measured in relation to flowering, fruiting and germination time. The results suggest that effects of flowering and fruiting time prevailed in subsequent phases, to some extent as far as to the juvenile phase, but effects of timing were complex and had partly opposing effects on different fitness components. Early flowers had higher fruit‐set and experiments indicated that synchronous peak flowering increased fruit‐set, but later flowers had higher seed mass. Peak fruiting was not associated with peak dispersal. Late fruits derived from late flowers promoted dispersal. Juvenile recruitment was enhanced by increasing seed size. We conclude that the phenology of flowering and fruiting in F. alnus comprises several features, each with different and sometimes counteracting effects on fitness components. From a general perspective, this result implies that we should not expect to find finely tuned matches in timing specifically between flowering and pollinators, and fruiting and seed dispersing birds.},
