# radcliffe
This repo began with a radcliffe exploratory seminar putitng together phenology and microclimatedata from warming experiments. 
This working group resulted in the following paper: 

Ettinger AK, Chuine I, Cook BI, Dukes JS, Ellison AM, Johnston MR, Panetta AM, Rollinson CR, Vitasse Y, Wolkovich EM. How do climate change experiments alter plot‚Äêscale climate?. Ecology Letters. 2019 Apr;22(4):748-63.

The microclimate database from the above paper is available on knb (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/): Ailene Ettinger, & Elizabeth Wolkovich. (2018). MicroClimate from Climate Change Experiments. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. urn:uuid:c4d6941a-137f-4400-bebb-12c03ae296b6.

The phenology database developed through this working group will be available on knb as well (currently only metadata are posted): Ailene Ettinger, & Elizabeth Wolkovich. (2022). Phenology from Warming Experiments (ExPhen). Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. urn:uuid:ebc8f601-e33e-4216-bae5-a0d8b61e9a10.
